For example, ['A+B=C','C+D=E'] is allowed, ['A+B+D=E'] is not allowed\nRESULT: final_value\n```\n\nassistant\nWe have these numbers [98, 68, 90, 47]. Our goal is to produce 73. Let's show the search process step by step:\n\nCurrent State #0: 73. Operations so far : [].\n\nThought    : Expand Node #0’s 1st child to build next frontier.\nAction     : Exploring operation 68+47=115. \nResulting number #0,0: 115.\n\nThought    : Expand Node #0’s 2nd child to build next frontier.\nAction     : Exploring operation 68+90=158. \nResulting number #0,0: 158.\n\nThought    : Expand Node #0’s 3rd child to build next frontier.\nAction     : Exploring operation 98-68=30. \nResulting number #0,0: 30.\n\nThought    : Expand Node #0’s 4th child to build next frontier.\nAction     : Exploring operation 98-47=51. \nResulting number #0,0: 51.\n\nThought    : Completed expansion of previous node into next frontier",
