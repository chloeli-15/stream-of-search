computes the average of the absolute differences between each number and the target number. This helps in guiding the search towards states that, on average, lead to the target number faster.\n\nLower scores indicate that, on average, the state leads to the target number more quickly, making the state more promising for reaching the target via additive operations.\n\n\nCurrent State #0: [98, 50, 62]\nOperations so far : ['98/6=16', '16-50=34', '34+62=96']\nResult so far : 96\n\nCurrent

For example, ['A+B=C','C+D=E'] is allowed, ['A+B+D=E'] is not allowed\nRESULT: final_value\n```\n\nQUICK LEARNING TASK: \nCreate a program that takes an array of integers as input and produces an output string describing a search algorithm to reach a target number using only arithmetic operations. Each operation should be a basic arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). The goal is to produce the lowest possible sum of the numbers via additive operations.\n\n\nCONTRAST ANALYSIS:\nSimilarities:\n- Both involve a list of integers\n- Both use arithmetic operations to reach the target number\n- Both aim to produce the lowest possible sum through additive operations\n\nDifferences:\n- This problem requires solving a search problem using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) guided by a **sum-based** heuristic, which computes the average of the absolute differences between each state\u2019s sum and the target number\n- This solution employs a **depth-first** guided by a **sum-based** heuristic to guide the search for the lowest sum of numbers reaching the target number\n\n\nALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION:\nCurrent State #0: 64:[94, 33, 3]. \nOperations so far :
