You are a helpful assistant.\nuser\nCombine these initial numbers [34, 13, 26] using only arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach the target value 17. All initial numbers must be used exactly once.\nConclude with the final result in EXACTLY this format:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\nOPERATIONS: list of string of operations performed, each string involving only 1 operation. For example, ['A+B=C','C+D=E'] is allowed, ['A+B+D=E'] is not allowed\nRESULT: final_value\n```\n\nassistant We have these numbers [34, 13, 26]. Our goal is to produce 17. Let's show the search process step by step:\nOne possible strategy is to use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) with Beam Size 5 guided by a **sum-based** heuristic, which computes the average of the absolute differences between each number and the target number.\nLower scores indicate that, on average, the numbers are closer to the target, making the state more promising for reaching the target via additive operations.\n\n\nCurrent State #0: 17:[34, 13, 26].
