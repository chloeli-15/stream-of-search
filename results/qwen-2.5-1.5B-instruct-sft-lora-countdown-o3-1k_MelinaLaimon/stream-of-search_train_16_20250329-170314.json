Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. We start with the numbers [64, 50, 12, 56].\n2. Our goal is to use all three numbers exactly once and combine them using arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to get exactly 70.\n\nLet's explore different combinations:\n\nA. Using division first:\n   - If we try dividing any number by another, it does not immediately lead us to 70. For example, 64 divided by 50 gives approximately 1.28, or 50 divided by 12 gives about 4.167, etc. None seems promising.\n\nB. Let's consider a different approach:\n   - One way might be to multiply two numbers first and then add or subtract the remaining number.\n   \n   Option A1: Try multiplying 64 and 50:\n     - 64 * 50 = 3200  \n     - Now, if we have 3200, we can see that 3200 + 12 equals 3212, but clearly that\u2019s too high.\n     \n   Option B1: Multiply 64 and 50:\n      - 64 * 50 = 3200  \n      - Then, check other possible operations on the intermediate result without success.\n      \nOption C1: Consider combining 50 and 12:\n   - 50 - 12 = 38  \n   - Adding this to 64 does not yield 70 either.\n   - Other possibilities do not give an exact match.\n     \nNone of these direct multiplications or additions yielded 70.\n\nAfter trying various combinations, one more combination was considered:\n   - Use addition and subtraction:\n     - From 50 and 12, if we subtract 12 from 50, we get 38.\n     - Now, if we add 64 to 38, we get 102.\n     - But since 102 is already higher than our target, we need to check if there was an error.\n       \nRechecking:\n- First perform 50 - 12 = 38.\n- Then 64 + 38 = 102.\nSince neither 102 nor 102 plus the remaining 56 gave 70, no valid arithmetic sequence using all numbers exactly once was found.\n\nGiven that none of the straightforward arithmetic methods led to 70, let\u2019s double-check if our assumption about the problem constraints (using every number exactly once) could have been incorrect.\n\nFinally, after considering alternative strategies and re-evaluating, it turns out that the correct solution involves:\n   - Multiplying 64 and 50 (or any order) giving 3200,\n   - Dividing 3200 by 56,\n   - Subtracting 12 from the result to make 70.\n\nThus, the operations are:\n   64 * 50 = 3200,\n   3200 / 56 = 57.647... (but note 3200/56 is not an integer),\n   57.647... - 12 = 45.647...\n   (We missed a crucial observation, so we realize that if we use 64 and 50 properly as described above in a specific order, the subtraction yields 45.647..., which when added to 12 gives 57.647..., then subtracting 56 brings us exactly to 70).\n\nTherefore, the correct solution is:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: [\"64*50=3200\", \"3200/56=57.647...\", \"57.647...-12=45.647...\", \"45.647...-56=-10.353\"]\nRESULT: -10.353\n```",

However, I can help you understand how to solve such a problem and then present my solution.\n\nTo reach the target value (50) using the given numbers [37, 48, 26, 74] and applying arithmetic operations strictly following the rules:\n\n1. We have four numbers and need to use them all exactly once.\n2. The available operations are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/).\n3. Each operation string should contain exactly one operation.\n\nOne possible way to combine these numbers is as follows:\n- First, we add 37 and 48 to get 85.\n- Then, if we subtract 26 from 85, we get 59.\n- Finally, if we multiply 59 by 74, we obtain 4366.\n  \nSince our goal is to reach 50, let's check:\n   - Operation sequence: \"ADD(37,48)=85\", then \"SUBTRACT(26,85)=59\", then \"MULTIPLY(59,74)=4366\"\n   \nHowever, notice that none of the intermediate results equals 50. Therefore, our attempt did not yield the desired result.\n\nAfter checking different combinations, we see no valid sequence that reaches exactly 50 when applied to the given numbers. Hence, the answer would typically be \"NO\" for the existence of an exact solution, followed by a final result of None.\n\nSo, here is a potential formatted answer based on the above reasoning:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: ['ADD(37,48)=85', 'SUBTRACT(26,85)=59', 'MULTIPLY(59,74)=4366']\nRESULT: None\n```",

First, note that subtracting 45 from 87 gives us -36. However, we can combine two other numbers later; so let's try adding 50 first.\n2. Add 50 and 47 (since it equals 97):\n   87 + 50 = 137  \n   So now we have two intermediate results: 137 and 97.\n3. Now use the remaining number 45 and subtract 97 (or vice versa). Since we want the sum equal to 72, consider:\n   137 \u2013 97 = 40  \n   That doesn\u2019t give 72. Instead, if we reverse our earlier operation or try another combination on 137 and 97 combined correctly, then observe:\n   137 \u2013 97 = 40  \n   Then add 45 to get:\n   40 + 45 = 85  \n   This does not match either.  \n4. A different approach was needed:  \n   We realize that multiplying 87 by 45 yields:\n   87 * 45 = 3915  \n   Then subtracting 47 gives:\n   3915 \u2013 47 = 3868  \n   But instead, combining 87 and 47 directly without the multiplication gives:\n   87 \u2013 47 = 40  \n   And then combine 40 and 45:\n   40 + 45 = 85  \n   Finally, multiply those together:\n   85 * 45 = 3825  \n   None of these yield 72.\n\nThe correct approach should be:\n1. Start by trying 87-45=42 (so you have 42 and 50)\n2. Now take 42*50=2100  \n3. Subtract 47 from 2100:  \n   2100 \u2013 47 = 2053  \n4. Then add the 47 back into the mix (note that since 47 wasn't involved before, we just include its value as part of the total after the addition):  \n   2053 + 47 = 2100  \n   Finally, divide 2100 by 3 to get 700 (but check again if possible, because 87, 45, and 50 were used exactly once).\n\nSince none of the above yielded exactly 72, the solution was incorrect. Let\u2019s re-examine our logic:\n\u2013 The subtraction 87-45 is valid but the subsequent arithmetic did not lead to 72.  \n\u2013 Another attempt was to try combinations like (87-45)*50 which gave 42*50=2100 and then substract 47 didn\u2019t work properly.  \n\u2013 Multiplication alone failed even when done correctly.\n\nAfter thorough consideration, there seems to be no valid arithmetic sequence using the given numbers exactly once that reaches 72. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: []\nRESULT: None\n```",
