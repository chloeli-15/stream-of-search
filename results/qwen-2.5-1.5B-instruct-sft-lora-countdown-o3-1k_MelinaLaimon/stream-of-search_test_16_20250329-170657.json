However, your puzzle involves combining arithmetic operations on a list of numbers (9, 62, 67, and 5). Let's try to solve it step-by-step.\n\nWe want an intermediate result equal to 20 when we use all three numbers exactly once. Here’s one way to do that:\n\n1. First, consider multiplying two numbers from the list:\n   - Multiplying 62 and 5 gives us 310.\n   \n2. Now, take the remaining number 9 and add/subtract the previous result (310):\n   - We can try adding 9 to 310 or subtracting 9 from 310. \n   - Trying 310 + 9 = 319 (too high)\n   - Trying 310 – 9 = 301 (still too high)\n   - Or try 9 – 310 = -291 (negative, so let’s check if there’s another possibility).\n\nSince our goal is 20 and none of these subtraction options yield 20, we need to reconsider. Notice that:\n\\[ \\frac{310}{67} \\approx 4.68 \\]\nand then:\n\\[ 62 - (62 \\times \\text{result}) \\]\n\nHowever, given the constraint that we must use all numbers exactly once and combine them via arithmetic operations, we need to look for an integer solution. One possible approach might involve negative numbers but since you asked specifically about positive integers, let’s think about:\n\\[ 62 - (62 \\times 0.46477... ) \\approx 62 - 29.6 \\approx 32.4 \\]\nBut again, we seek exact 20.\n\nLet’s try:\n\\[ 62 - 310 \\div 67 = 62 - 4.68 = 57.32 \\]\nThat does not work either. \n\nAnother attempt:\n\\[ 62 - 67 = -5 \\]\nThen,\n\\[ 9 + (-5) = 4 \\]\nor,\n\\[ 9 - (-5) = 14 \\]\n\nNone seem close. Let’s try:\n\\[ 62 - (62 \\times 0.46477...) \\approx 62 - 29.6 = 32.4 \\]\nAgain, not 20.\n\nGiven all possibilities, none seems to lead directly to 20. However, if we allow division first as per the problem requirements, then:\n\\[ 62 - (62 \\div 67) \\cdot 67 \\]\nThis yields:\n\\[ 62 - (62 \\div 67) \\cdot 67 = 62 - 5.478... \\cdot 67 = 62 - 37.8 = 24.2 \\]\n\nStill off, but if we force:\n\\[ 62 - 24.2 = 37.8 \\]\nAnd then:\n\\[ 9 - 37.8 = -28.8 \\]\n\nNo valid sequence found within the constraints. Thus, after checking various combinations, no valid arithmetic chain exists under the given rules.\n\nThe answer is:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: []\nRESULT: None\n```",
