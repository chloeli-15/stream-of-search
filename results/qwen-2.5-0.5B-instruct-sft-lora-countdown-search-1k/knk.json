Since they both claim that the other is lying, we can analyze their statements based on whether each person is telling the truth or lying.\n1. If Matthew is a knight, then his first statement (Jackson is a knave) must be true. But if Jackson is a knave, then Jackson's second statement (Matthew is not a knight) would also be false, which contradicts our initial assumption that Matthew is a knight. Therefore, Matthew cannot be a knight.\n2. If Matthew is a knave, then his first statement (Jackson is a knave) must be false, meaning Jackson is indeed a knave. This aligns with Jackson's second statement, so Jackson is indeed a knave. In this case, Matthew could either be a knight or a knave, but since we've already determined he isn't a knight, he must be a knave as well. However, this leads to an inconsistency because we assumed he was a knave initially. Thus, this scenario is invalid.\n\nMoving on to considering Jackson:\n1. If Jackson is a knight, then his first statement (Matthew is not a knight) must be true. This means Matthew is indeed a knave. Now, let's check Jackson's second statement (Matthew is not a knight). Since we established that Matthew is a knave, this statement is consistent, making Jackson a knight validly.\n2. If Jackson is a knave, then his first statement (Matthew is not a knight) must be false, meaning Matthew is actually a knight. However, this conflicts with Jackson's second statement (Matthew is not a knight), making this scenario impossible.\n\nGiven these deductions, we conclude:\nFinal Result: Knight, Knave\n\n```\nKnight, Knave\n```\nConcluding Statement: No one is a knight, the other is a knave.",

Therefore, Jacob must be a knave.\n   - If Aurora is a knave, then her statement \"Aurora is a knight or Jacob is a knight\" must be false.

If Olivia is a knight, then her initial statement must be true. This implies that Sebastian is also a knight. But if Sebastian is a knight, his subsequent statement would contradict it (since all three cannot be knights). Therefore, Olivia cannot be a knight; she must be a knave.\n2. With Olivia being a knave, her initial statement is false. This means either she is not a knight, or Sebastian is not a knight. Since we already established that Olivia is a knave, Sebastian must indeed be a knight.\n3. Now considering Chloe's statement: \"Sebastian is a knight\"\n4. Since we've determined Sebastian is a knight from step 2, this aligns with Chloe's statement. Thus, Chloe could be either a knight or a knave, but both options lead to consistent results.\n5.

Therefore, Logan must be lying, implying that at least one of them (Logan) is a knave.\nExploring Node 1: All three individuals are knaves\nAll three are false, so all initial statements are false. This results in no solution. No Solution\nMoving to Node 2: Jack is a knave\nIf Jack is a knave, his initial statement is false, meaning Logan is a knight. This leads to contradictory results for Victoria's initial statement as well. No Solution\nMoving to Node 3: Jack is a knight\nIf Jack is a knight, his initial statement is true, meaning Logan is indeed a knave. This leaves us with two possibilities:\n- Victoria is a knave, making her initial statement false, resulting in only two knights left: Jack and Logan\n- Victoria is a knight, making her initial statement true, leading to no solution. No Solution\nMoving to Node 4: Victoria is a knight\nIf Victoria is a knight, her initial statement is true, meaning Jack is indeed a knave. Now we have only two possibilities:\n- Jack is a knave, making Logan a knight\n- Jack is a knight, making Logan a knave\nExploring Subnode 4a: Both Jack and Logan are knaves\nBoth are false, but this conflicts with Jack's initial statement, so no solution. No Solution\nExploring Subnode 4b: Jack is a knave, Logan is a knight\nThis scenario satisfies all initial conditions: Jack's statement is false, Victoria's statement is true, and Logan's statement is true.

Therefore, Harper is indeed a knife, which means both Jack and Mason are also knives. This leads to contradiction, so hypothesis 0 is invalid\n\nExploring Hypothesis 1: Only 2 are Knives\nMason, Jack, and Harper are all knaves. If Harper says that Mason is a knife, then it follows that Mason must also be a knife, leading to contradiction. Thus, there are no knaves, but we still have 3 people, none of whom are knights, resulting in no valid solution, so hypothesis 1 is invalid\n\nExploring Hypothesis 2: Only 1 is a Knife\nThis scenario results in 3 knaves and 1 liar. However, if Mason says Harper is not a knave, then since he is lying, Harper must actually be a knave, leading to contradiction. Hence, this hypothesis 2 is invalid\n\nExploring Hypothesis 3: All 3 are Knights\nAll three individuals - Mason, Jack, and Harper - would be telling the truth. Given Mason's statement \"Harper is not a knave\" being true, Harper cannot be a knave. Jack saying \"if Jack is a knight then Harper is a knight\" implies that Jack must be a knight because if he were a knave, Harper would necessarily be a knave as well, contradicting the first part.

So who is a knight and who is a knave?.\nConclude with the final result in EXACTLY this format:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\\ \nRESULT: final_value\n```\nThe final_value should be statements separated by commas. For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nassistant\nCurrent State of Information:\n1. Elizabeth claims that Samuel is a knight if and only if Elizabeth is a knight.\n2. Amelia says Samuel is not a knight.\n3. Samuel states that Elizabeth is a knave.\n\nExploring Node 1.0: Elizabeth is a knight\nAnalysis of Node 1.0:\n- If Elizabeth is a knight, then her claim must be true, so Samuel is indeed a knight.\n- This would imply that Amelia's statement is false (because Samuel is a knight), leading to contradiction with Samuel stating Elizabeth is a knave.\nConclusion for Node 1.0: No Solution\n\nMoving to Node 1.1: Elizabeth is a knave\nAnalysis of Node 1.1:\n- If Elizabeth is a knave, then her claim must be false, meaning Samuel is not a knight.\n- Amelia's statement becomes relevant; since Samuel is not a knight, she cannot be telling the truth about Elizabeth being a knave, making her statement incorrect.\n- The remaining scenario is Samuel stating Elizabeth is a knave, which aligns with our initial condition.\nConclusion for Node 1.1: Final Result: Amelia, Samuel are knights, Elizabeth is a knave\n\nExploring Node 2.0: Amelia is a knight\nAnalysis of Node 2.0:\n- If Amelia is a knight, then her statement must be true, so Samuel is not a knight.\n- Samuel's statement now reads: Elizabeth is a knave, consistent with Amelia's claim.\n- Elizabeth's initial claim remains unchanged, still false, implying Samuel is indeed a knight.\nConclusion for Node 2.0: No Solution\n\nMoving to Node 2.1: Amelia is a knave\nAnalysis of Node 2.1:\n- If Amelia is a knave, then her statement must be false, so Samuel is a knight.\n- Samuel's statement is now irrelevant as it no longer holds true.\n- This results in contradiction with Elizabeth's initial claim.\nConclusion for Node 2.1: No Solution\n\nExploring Node 3.0: Samuel is a knight\nAnalysis of Node 3.0:\n- If Samuel is a knight, his statement must be true, so Elizabeth is indeed a knave.\n- Amelia's statement is false, indicating Samuel is not a knight, which contradicts the initial assumption.\nConclusion for Node 3.0: No Solution\n\nMoving to Node 3.1: Samuel is a knave\nAnalysis of Node 3",

Since we already know Avery is a knave, let's assume the opposite scenario, i.e., Avery is a knight, then verify consistency:\n   6) If Avery is a knight, then Ethan's statement would be true (Avery is a knight or Liam is a knight), which contradicts our initial assumption that Ethan is a knight. Hence, Avery cannot be a knight.\n\n6) Therefore, let's try another possibility, assuming Avery is a knave, then check consistency with all initial conditions:\n    7) In this case, Ethan's statement becomes valid: \"Avery is a knight or Liam is a knight\" being true since both are indeed knaves. This implies Ethan is a knight, which is consistent with all initial conditions.\n\n8) Now, checking for additional information:\n    9) Liam claims \"Ethan is not a knave\", as initially assumed, this is correct, confirming Liam is a knight.\n    10) Finally, looking at Luke's statement, it remains unaffected by these changes, remaining false but consistent with his original claim about Avery's status.\n\nConclusion:\nAll initial assumptions lead to no contradictions and all initial values remain accurate.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nassistant\nCurrent State of the Problem: NO SOLUTION\nAnalyzing Zoey's Statement: Zoey stated that Amelia is not a knight. This means either Zoey, James, Olivia, or Amelia is a knave.\n1. If Zoey is a knight, then her statement is true, so Amelia must be a knave. James cannot be a knave, as if he were, his statement would be false, which contradicts Zoey's statement being true.\n2. If Zoey is a knave, then her statement is false, so Amelia must be a knight. James could be either a knight or a knave, but since we have no additional information to distinguish between them, let's consider both cases.\n\nMoving on to James' Statement: James said, \"Olivia is a knight or Zoey is a knave.\"\n3. If Zoey is a knight (from Zoey's initial statement), then James' statement becomes \"Olivia is a knight\", which is consistent.\n4. If Zoey is a knave, then James' statement becomes \"Olivia is a knave\" or \"Zoey is a knave\". Since Zoey is a knave, James' statement is false, implying Olivia is also a knave. This creates a contradiction because if Olivia is a knave, she cannot be a knight according to James' original statement. Thus, Zoey cannot be a knave, leading us back to case 1.\n\n5. Considering all possibilities for James' statement, we need to look at the remaining scenarios involving Olivia and Amelia. We know Zoey is a knight, so James' statement simplifies to \"Olivia is a knight\".\n6. If Zoey is a knight, James' statement is now \"Olivia is a knight\", which is true. This leaves Olivia as a knight, and thus Amelia as a knave. Now we check Zoey's statement again: \"Amelia is not a knight\". Since Amelia is a knave, Zoey's statement is false, making her a knight, which contradicts our assumption.\n\n7. Therefore, James' initial statement must be false, meaning Zoey is a knave. This implies Olivia is also a knave, leaving only Amelia as a knight.\n\nExploring Final Scenario: All KNIGHTS=AMELIA,KNIGHTS, No MORE INFO\nAll KNIGHTS=AMELIA, KNAVES=ZOY,EJ\n0,0,0,",

Therefore, Jackson must be a knight, making Mia also a knight.\nNow we have two knights (Jackson and Mia) confirmed. Let's look at Penelope's Statement: \"Jackson is a knight\".

Aiden expressed that Aurora is a knave if and only if Aurora is a knight. Riley asserted: \"Noah is a knight or Aiden is a knight\". So who is a knight and who is a knave?.\nConclude with the final result in EXACTLY this format:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\\ \nRESULT: final_value\n```\nThe final_value should be statements separated by commas. For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nassistant\nCurrent State of Facts:\n1. Aurora: Noah is a knave or Riley is a knave\n2. Noah: Noah is a knight if and only if Riley is a knight\n3. Aiden: Aurora is a knave if and only if Aurora is a knight\n4. Riley: Noah is a knight or Aiden is a knight\nExploring Reasoning Steps:\n1. From #1: If Noah is a knave, then Riley must also be a knave. Otherwise, Aurora would contradict her statement.\n2. From #2: Since Noah is either a knight or a knave, we can infer that Riley must be a knave as well.\n3. Now let's focus on #3: Aiden says Aurora is both a knight and a knave. This creates an inconsistency because someone cannot be both a knight and a knave simultaneously. Therefore, Aiden must be lying, meaning Aurora is neither a knight nor a knave.\n4. With Aiden lying, #1 becomes invalid, implying Noah and Riley might not both be knaves. Let's explore further using #3: If Aiden is a knave, then Aurora must be a knave (from #3). And since Aurora is a knave, #1 now states: \"Riley is a knave\", which aligns with our new understanding.\n5. Moving to #4: We have established that Aiden is a knave. Thus, Noah and Riley cannot both be knaves; they must both be knights for Noah's statement (#2) to hold true. Combining #1 and #4, we conclude Noah is a knight, and therefore, Riley is also a knight.\n6. Finally, looking at #2 again, with Noah being a knight and Riley being a knight, Noah's statement holds true. This means Aurora must indeed be a knave, consistent with #1.\n\nAll initial assumptions lead us to the following conclusion:\nAurora: Knave, Noah: Knight, Aiden: Knave, Riley: Knight\n```\nYES, RESULT: knave,noah,knight,aiden,knight\n```\nConcluding Statement Explained:\n1. Initial Analysis: All four individuals' initial statements were contradictory, leading to no clear path forward without additional information.\n2. After Re-evaluating: Aiden's claim about Aurora becoming a knight led to inconsistencies. His falsehood allowed for more logical deductions.\n3. Final Result: By eliminating Aiden's claim",
