At the end, output the result in the required format.\nThought: To solve this problem, we can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) guided by a **sum-based** heuristic, which computes the average of the absolute differences between each number and the target number.\nLower scores indicate that, on average, the numbers are closer to the target, making the state more promising for reaching the target via additive operations.\nLower scores lead to deeper nodes in the search tree, potentially leading to a faster convergence towards the goal.\nLower scores make the state more balanced, allowing for a wider range of valid intermediate results during the search.\nUpper scores indicate that, on average, the numbers are farther from the target, making the state less promising for reaching the target via additive operations.\nLower upper scores indicate that, on average, the numbers are closer together, reducing the diversity of possible next states at later levels of the search.\nOne possible strategy is to expand node #0\u2019s children in order of increasing average absolute distance from the target number.\nLower scores lead to deeper nodes in the search tree, potentially leading to a faster convergence towards the goal.\nLower scores make the state more balanced, allowing for a wider range of valid intermediate results during the search.\nUpper scores indicate that, on average, the numbers are farther from the target, making the state less promising for reaching the target via additive operations.\nLower upper scores indicate that, on average, the numbers are closer together, reducing the diversity of possible next states at later levels of the search.\n \nInitial Numbers: [24, 8, 96].
