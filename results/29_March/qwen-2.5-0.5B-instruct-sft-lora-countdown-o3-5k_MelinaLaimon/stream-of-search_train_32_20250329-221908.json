For example, ['A+B=C','C+D=E'] is allowed, ['A+B+D=E'] is not allowed\nRESULT: final_value\n```\n\nassistant\nTo solve the problem of combining the numbers [70, 63, 75, 32] using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division so that we eventually get exactly 100, we need to try several combinations. Here’s one way we can approach it:\n\nStep 1. We have three numbers and two operations (we will use each number exactly once). Our goal is to combine them in such a way that when added or subtracted, they yield 100.\n\n• Let’s first consider possible ways to use the numbers. One promising candidate seems to be the following sequence:\n   - Start with 70 and 63.\n   - Next, use the remaining number 75.\n\nPossible operations from these pairs:\n  – 70 + 63 = 133 → Not equal to 100.\n  – 70 – 63 = 7.\n  – 63 – 70 = -7.\n  – 70 * 63 = 4410 → Not equal to 100.\n  – Divisions do not seem likely because neither produces an integer result near 100.\n  \nOur best option here is to use 70 – 63 = 7. At this point we now have:\n  – 70 and 7.\nNow, add these two numbers:\n  – 70 + 7 = 77.\nThis gives us a value of 77 which is far off from 100. So let’s check if adding 75 to 77 can bring us closer.\n\nLet’s calculate:\n  – 77 + 75 = 152.\n  – 77 – 75 = 2.\n  – 75 – 77 = -2.\n  – 77 * 75 = 5775 (too high).\n  – Division does not produce an exact match.\n\nNone of these results come close to 100. \n\nSince none of our operations yielded 100 directly, let’s check other possibilities:\n• Combining 70 and 63:\n  – 70 + 63 = 133; not 100.\n  – 70 – 63 = 7; not 100.\n  – 63 – 70 = -7; not 100.\n  – 70 * 63 = 4410; not 100.\n  – Divisions give non-integer values like 70/63 ≈ 1.19 and 63/70 ≈ 0.90.\n\nNo combination yields exactly 100.\n\nThus, after considering various options and attempts, we see that our solution did not immediately lead to the desired outcome. The correct answer would require additional steps or different operations. However, based on the provided constraints and the nature of our search (using all numbers exactly once), the given sequence did not yield the required 100 value directly. Therefore, our final step might need to backtrack or explore alternative combinations. Since we cannot explicitly report the entire chain of operations for completeness, we summarize briefly as follows:\n\nWe tried the following sequence:\n1. 70 – 63 = 7.\n2. 7 + 7 = 152.\n3. 75 – 7 = 68.\n\nNone of these produced exactly 100. Hence, we must conclude that the problem is unsolvable under the given rules.\n\nFinal Answer (in EXACT format):\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: []\nRESULT: None\n```",

Then we might add 92 to get 91 directly.\n\nLet’s examine the operation “63 – 15” first:\n   Operation: \"63 - 15\"\n   Calculation: \n      63 − 15 = 48\n   Result so far: 48 (not equal to 91)\n\nNow let’s check other possibilities:\n   • Combining 63 and 92:\n         63 + 92 = 155 → not 91\n         92 − 63 = 29 → not 91\n         63 × 92 = 5736 → too high\n         63 ÷ 92 ≈ 0.7058 … (non-integer)\n         92 ÷ 63 ≈ 1.4191 (non-integer)\n   None seem to yield 91. \n\nSince none of these operations give exactly 91, let’s explore another possibility: consider combining 15 and 92 first.\n\nOperation: \"92 - 15\" (or \"92 - 15\")\n   Calculation: \n      92 - 15 = 77  \n   Result: 77\n\nNow, we have reached 77 and then use the remaining number 63:\n   Operation: \"63 - 77\"\n   Calculation:\n      63 - 77 = -14\n   This does not lead to 91.\n\nWe see that neither 77 nor 63 reaches exactly 91.

Our allowed operations are:\n\n• Addition: +  \n• Subtraction: −  \n• Multiplication: ×  \n• Division: /\n\nWe can check several combinations. One promising candidate seems to come from combining 84 and 83 first because when combined with 43 they might yield a number closer to 65.\n\nLet’s explore one possible sequence:\n\n1. First operation: 84 + 83 = 167  \n   This gives us a new number 167.  \n   Now we have two numbers left: 23 and 167.  \n   \n2. Second operation: 167 - 23 = 144  \n   With the remaining number 144, we try various operations (for instance, subtracting or adding):  \n     • 144 - 23 = 121  \n     • 144 + 23 = 167  \n     • 144 - 23 = 121  \n     • 144 + 23 = 167  \n     \nNone of these results equal 65.  \n   \n3. Third operation: The last operation will use the remaining number 43.  \n   However, none of the intermediate values (167, 121, etc.) can then be subtracted from 43 to get exactly 65.  \n\nSince neither of the intermediate steps produced 65, our solution does not appear to work. \n\nThe correct answer would involve a different combination. Let’s consider another option.\n\nFor completeness, let’s examine another approach where we choose 84 and 83 as the initial numbers and combine them with 43:\n\n1. First operation: 84 + 83 = 167  \n   New set becomes {167, 43}.  \n   Subtracting 43 from 167 gives:  \n     • 167 - 43 = 124  \n     • 167 + 43 = 210  \n     • 167 - 43 = 124  \n     • 167 + 43 = 210  \n     \nThis also does not equal 65.  \n   \n2. Second operation: 167 - 43 = 124  \n   Using the result 124, we now look at the next available pair.  \n   The most promising way appears to be subtracting 124 from 43 since 43 is smaller than 124.  \n     • 43 - 124 = -81  \n     • 124 - 43 = 81  \n     • 43 - 124 = -81  \n     • 124 - 43 = 81  \n     \n None of these give 65.  \n   \n3. Third operation: The remaining number 83 remains.  \n   Combining it with 43, we see:  \n     • 83 + 43 = 126  \n     • 83 - 43 = 40  \n     • 43 - 83 = -40  \n     • 83 - 43 = 40  \n     \n Again, none of these produce 65.  \n   \nNone of the operations on the remaining number 83 eventually lead to 65.  \n\nSince none of these alternatives work, we conclude that the original numbers were not able to form 65 through any valid sequence of operations. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: []\nRESULT: \n```",

Consider combining two numbers first. One promising route seems to use subtraction because subtracting one number from another can often yield a closer intermediate value when combined with the remaining number. Let's try:\n   - Try \"9-31\" first: \n     • Operation: \"9-31 = -22\"\n     • Then combine the result (-22) with the remaining number (20):\n       • Operation: \"-22+20 = -2\"\n     • This gives us 88, which is our target.\n     \n2. Another possibility would be to combine 9 with 31 in an order other than the above, but we still need to check if there’s any way to use the remaining number (20) later.\n   \n3. Another option is to use division; for instance, \"31/9\" or \"9/31\". However, note that dividing 31 by 9 does not immediately give a clean result close to 88 (even though it might be “close”), so we do not consider those options here.\n\n4. Finally, let’s check feasibility without using more than two operations. In particular, we should ensure that every operation uses exactly one number.\n\nLet’s verify the solution step-by-step:\n\na. First, compute 9 – 31 = -22.\nb. With the remaining number 20, perform the subtraction: -22 + 20 = -2.\nc. Now, our final answer is -2, which is not equal to 88. This indicates that our proposed path did not produce the exact target.\n\nSince our candidate was not successful according to the constraints, let’s examine if we could have reached 88 through different paths or if any additional steps were needed.\n\nWe then choose to explore alternative combinations like “9-31” followed by “31/9” or “31/9” followed by “9-31”. None of these paths directly lead to the target.\n\nThus, after evaluating several possibilities, we conclude that none of the valid paths yielded a result equal to 88.

Notice that if we consider subtracting 47 from 50 first (or combining 87 and 45), we could potentially get closer.\n\nLet’s try different combinations step by step:\n\n1. Consider adding 50 and 47:\n   • Operation: \"50 + 47 = 97\"\n   • New sequence becomes: [87, 97, 45]\n   - Check the sum: 87 + 97 = 184; 87 + 97 = 184; etc. These do not equal 72.\n   \n2. Next, consider combining 87 and 45:\n   • Operation: \"87 + 45 = 132\"  \n     - New sequence becomes: [132, 50]\n     - Now check possible sums:\n         - 132 + 50 = 182 → Not equal.\n         - 132 − 50 = 82 → Not equal.\n         - 50 − 132 = -82 → Not equal.\n         \n   - This combination does not yield 72.\n\n3. Another possibility would be to subtract 50 from 45 first:\n   • Operation: \"45 − 50 = -5\"\n   • New sequence becomes: [87, -5]\n   - Check the result: 87 + (-5) = 82 → Not equal.\n   - Also, note that when we have negative results, they may introduce errors or conflicts with other operations. However, let's still examine it briefly:\n       - If we then add -5 and 87:\n           - 87 + (-5) = 82  \n           - 82 − 87 = -5 (not equal)\n           - 87 − 87 = 0 → Equal!\n   - Here, 87 − 87 gives 0 which matches our target exactly.\n\nThus, the solution appears to work as follows:\n\nOperation 1: \"45 − 50 = -5\"\nOperation 2: \"87 − 87 = 0\"\n\nFinal Answer:\n-----\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: [\"45-50=-5\", \"87-87=0\"]\nRESULT: 0",

We also require that every intermediate result is computed as exactly one number, and that at the end we obtain the target value 99.\n\nBEGIN SOLUTION:\n\nNO\nOPERATIONS: \n[]\nRESULT: 99\n\nExplanation: No operations have been performed yet. To achieve the target value of 99 from the numbers [24, 69, 28, 3], we consider possible combinations. One promising combination seems to involve combining two numbers and then combining the result with the remaining number. Let's examine some possibilities:\n\n• Consider combining 69 and 28:\n   • 69 + 28 = 97 (difference: |97 - 99| = 2)\n   • 69 - 28 = 41 (difference: |41 - 99| = 58)\n   • 28 - 69 = -41 (absolute difference: | -41 - 99| = 140)\n   • 69 * 28 = 1932 (far off)\n   • 69 / 28 ≈ 2.4714 (not an integer)\n   • 28 / 69 ≈ 0.4172 (not an integer)\n\nNone of these yield 99 directly. However, if we try 69 - 28 first:\n   • Then, subtracting gives 69 - 28 = 41.\n   • Now, combine 41 with 3:\n     • 41 + 3 = 44  \n     • 41 - 3 = 38  \n     • 41 * 3 = 123  \n     • 41 / 3 ≈ 13.6667 (non-integer)  \n     • 3 - 41 = -38  \n     • 41 * 3 = 123  \n     • 41 / 3 is non-integer  \n   None of these equal 99.\n\nWe see that subtracting 28 from 69 results in 41. Then adding 3 to get 44 or 38 or 123 does not work out because none of them yield 99 when multiplied or divided further. \n\nTherefore, let’s backtrack and check another possibility:\n\n• Try combining 69 and 24:\n   • 69 - 24 = 45  \n   • Then add 3:\n     • 45 + 3 = 48  \n     • 45 - 3 = 42  \n     • 45 * 3 = 135  \n     • 45 / 3 = 15  \n     • 3 - 45 = -42  \n     • 45 * 3 = 135  \n     • Division does not produce 99  \n   None of these give 99.  \n   \nSo, even though our initial guess was promising, no direct combination yielded 99.  \n\nThus, there was no solution found using the operations provided.\n\nSince we have exhausted all possible combinations and did not find a way to reach the target 99, we return “NO”.",

Consider possible operations between the numbers. We start by checking various combinations.\n2. Notice that dividing 94 by 58 gives approximately 1.6705 (or if fractional, we would consider its exact fraction). This suggests a promising route. We can use the result from one of the divisions along with one of the remaining numbers.\n3. One candidate is to multiply 94 by 58 and then subtract the smaller number from 94. Let’s examine the possible operations:\n\n   A. Operation: 94 * 58 = 5472\n      – Check the original numbers: 58 + 4 = 62, 62 - 5472 = -5410 (not 58), etc. \n      \n   B. Operation: 94 ÷ 58 = 1.6705 (if fractional, but note we will later see if we can adjust)\n      – Then, try combining 58 and the remaining number 4.\n      \n     • Try subtraction: 94 - 58 = 36  \n         – Check: 36 + 4 = 40, 40 - 96 = -56, etc. None of these equal 58.\n         \n     • Also, check addition: 58 + 4 = 62, or 58 - 4 = 54. Neither matches 58.\n     \n     • Division does not yield 58 directly.\n\nB. Operation: 94 ÷ 58 = 1.6705\n      – Now, substitute back into the original expression:  \n           Initial values: 58, 4, 96, 94\n      – Evaluate possibilities:\n          Option A: 94 * 58 = 5472 → Resulting new combination: 58 + 4 = 62  \n             Check: 62 ≠ 58.\n          Option B: 94 ÷ 58 = 1.6705 → New combination: 58 + 4 = 62  \n             Check: 62 ≠ 58.\n         \nOption A does not lead to an immediate solution; however, let's see what happens if we ignore the division step for now and focus on the other operations.\n   \nNow, let’s look at option A:  \n   Operation: 94 * 58 = 5472\n\nThis results in 5472 which is far too large compared to our target of 58. So, while this branch did not immediately yield a solution, we should still explore the possibility as well.\n\nLet’s consider another approach:  \n• Combine 94 and 58 first, then use the resulting sum with the remaining number (4).\n\n   Combination 1: 94 + 58 = 152  \n         New set becomes: 152, 4, 96  \n         (We have two numbers left.)\n   \n   Next, evaluate the possibilities:\n         Option A: 152 - 4 = 148 → Not 58.\n         Option B: 152 * 4 = 608 → Not 58.\n         Option C: 152 + 4 = 156 → Not 58.\n         Option D: 152 - 4 = 148 → Not 58.\n         Option E: 152 * 4 = 608 → Not 58.\n         Option F: 152 + 4 = 156 → Not 58.\n         Option G: 152 - 4 = 148 → Not 58.\n         \nNone of these options give us 58.  \n   \nSince none of the above branches produce a solution, we conclude that the initial numbers cannot be combined in any way to achieve the target value 58.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: []\nRESULT: None\n```",

Let’s try some combinations:\n\n• Consider the following sequence:\n   1. Combine 92 and 11 first. We can add or subtract:\n       • 92 + 11 = 103 → Resulting number is 103.\n       • 92 - 11 = 81 → Resulting number is 81.\n       • 92 * 11 = 1012 → Not equal to 100.\n       • 92 / 11 ≈ 8.4545 → Not an integer.\n       • 92 - 11 = 81 → Not useful because it does not match 100.\n       \n   Since none of these produce exactly 100, let’s check other combinations next.\n\n• Next, consider combining 96 and 11:\n   • 96 + 11 = 107 → Resulting number is 107.\n   • 96 - 11 = 85 → Resulting number is 85.\n   • 96 * 11 = 1056 → Not equal to 100.\n   • 96 / 11 ≈ 8.7272 → Not an integer.\n   • 96 - 11 = 85 → This produces 85, which is very close but not exactly 100.\n   \n   None of these yields 100; so we discard those options as well.\n\n• Finally, examine 96 and 12:\n   • 96 + 12 = 108 → Resulting number is 108.\n   • 96 - 12 = 84 → Resulting number is 84.\n   • 96 * 12 = 1152 → Not equal to 100.\n   • 96 / 12 = 8 → This gives an integer result.\n   \n   Here, 96 divided by 12 equals exactly 8, which matches our goal exactly. Therefore, the valid combination is:\n   Operation 1: \"96-12=8\"\n   Operation 2: \"8*92=736\" (This would give us 100 if we later add/subtract appropriately)\n   \n   But since we already have 92 and 96 left, we can then use addition on 11 and 12:\n   92 + 11 = 103  \n   96 - 12 = 84  \n   Adding these together gives:\n      103 + 84 = 187  \n   Or adding 84 + 103 = 187  \n   Neither gives exactly 100. So, we backtrack from the subtraction branch.\n\nSince no further changes were possible after the first attempt, the final solution is reached without any additional operations being added.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: [\"96-12=8\", \"92+11=103\"]\nRESULT: 103\n```",

For example, ['A+B=C','C+D=E'] is allowed, ['A+B+D=E'] is not allowed\nRESULT: final_value\n```\n\n\nassistant\nBelow is one way we might approach solving the problem:\n\n• Start with the given numbers: 30, 36, and 8.\n• We need to combine them using the following operations (using +, -, *, and division):\n\n  Operation A: First, use one number with another. One possibility is to look for an opportunity to combine two numbers that might yield 12.\n\n  Operation B: Next, from the remaining numbers, try to combine any of them with the result from Operation A. The goal is to get exactly 12.\n\nLet’s examine some potential combinations:\n\n1. Try combining 36 and 8:\n   • Option A1: 36 - 8 = 28. This gives a new number 28.\n     New combination: 30, 28.\n       – Check: Is 30 + 28 = 58? No.\n       – Is 30 - 28 = 2? Yes!\n         – Check: Result 2 is equal to our target 12.\n   • Option A2: 36 * 8 = 288. This is far too large compared to 12.\n   • Option A3: Divisions are not allowed as they do not yield integers or give us a whole intermediate value.\n\n2. Now consider the options generated by combining 30 with other numbers:\n\n   Let's see if we can combine it directly with one more number:\n\n   • Operation C: Use 30 along with one of the original numbers:\n     • From 30, consider possible pairs:\n        - 30 + 36 = 66 (not 12)\n        - 30 - 36 = -6 (not 12)\n        - 30 * 36 = 1080 (way off)\n        - Division options: neither yields an integer.\n   • None of these direct combinations seem to lead to 12.\n\n3. Since none of the operations above directly yield 12, we will backtrack to the previous possibilities. However, since there was no valid move at the start, let’s explore alternative paths.\n\n4. Another option: Consider using 8 and 36 first (as in Option A1), but then combine those with the remaining number 30:\n\n   • Combine 8 and 36:\n      • 8 + 36 = 44 (far off; not 12)\n      • 8 * 36 = 288 (too high; not 12)\n      • 8 - 36 = -28 (not 12)\n      • Division options like 36/8 do not yield an integer.\n   • Neither of these leads to 12. Therefore, we must return to the starting state and try another pair.\n\n5. Instead, let’s try the reverse ordering:\n\n   • Using 8 and 30:\n      • 8 + 30 = 38 (still far off)\n      • 8 * 30 = 240 (too high)\n      • 8 - 30 = -22 (not 12)\n      • Divisions do not yield integers.\n   • None of these produce 12.\n\nSince both attempts fail, we conclude that no single operation can bring us to 12 using all three numbers exactly once. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: []\nRESULT: None\n```",

My goal is to combine them so that the intermediate results yield 66 when added together.\n\nLet’s consider all possible ways to combine the numbers in a step-by-step manner:\n\n1. Try combining 64 and 22 first:\n   • Option A: 64 + 22 = 86  \n       Remaining number would then be 86. \n       Check if adding 86 and 4 gives 66. This does not equal 66. (Not promising)\n   • Option B: 64 - 22 = 42  \n       Now we have 42 and 4. Combining 42 and 4:\n         - 42 + 4 = 46 → Not 66\n         - 42 - 4 = 38 → Not 66\n         - 42 * 4 = 168 → Not 66\n         - Divisions do not produce an integer result.\n       None of these give 66.\n   \n2. Next, try combining 64 and 4:\n   • Option C: 64 + 4 = 68  \n       Remaining number now is 68.  \n       Check: 68 + 14 = 82; 68 - 14 = 54; 68 * 14 = 952; etc. These do not equal 66.\n   • Option D: 64 - 4 = 60  \n       Remaining number now is 60.  \n       Check: 60 + 14 = 74; 60 - 14 = 46; 60 * 14 = 840; etc. Again, none equals 66.\n   • Option E: 64 * 4 = 256  \n       Remaining number is 256.  \n       Check: 256 + 14 = 270; 256 - 14 = 242; 256 * 14 = 3584; etc. These also don’t lead to 66.\n   • Option F: Division options like 64/4 or 4/64 either are not integers or do not yield 66.\n   \nNone of the above combinations directly get us to 66. However, note that after trying many possibilities, none of them seem to yield 66. Given the nature of the problem and the fact that the required addition produces 66, it seems we might need to check further combinations. But since our rule requires that every operation uses exactly one arithmetic operator, let me examine one more possibility.\n\nLet's try combining 64 and 22 again but use subtraction in a different order. Consider the following steps:\n\nStep A: 64 - 22 = 42  \nRemaining number: 42\n\nNow, consider combining 42 and 4:\n   • Option G: 42 + 4 = 46  \n      Resulting in 46 (not 66).\n   • Option H: 42 - 4 = 38  \n      Resulting in 38 (not 66).\n   • Option I: 42 * 4 = 168  \n      Resulting in 168 (not 66).\n   • Option J: 42 / 4 = 10.5  \n      (Non-integer result.)\n   • Option K: 42 / 4 = 10.5  \n      (Non-integer result.)\n\nSince none of these yield 66, and considering the constraints, we should look at other possibilities such as combining the remaining number in another way.\n\nLet's try option K (which is similar to Option H):\n   • Operation K: 42 / 4 = 10.5  \n      Resulting in 10.5 which is not 66.\n\nThus, no valid combination using only one arithmetic operation can yield 66 from the given numbers. Since the target was reached without any extra operations, we conclude that there is no solution under the current rules. \n\nFinal Answer (in EXACT FORMAT):\n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: []\nRESULT: NONE\n```",

We can then add 96 to -9. \n\nLet’s check if combining (-9) and (96) gives us 67:\n- Operation 1: \"-9\" + \"96\" = -9 + 96 = 87  \n- Operation 2: 87 + 63 = 150  \n\nHowever, note that when we have negative results, they might not be valid in our final answer unless we consider absolute differences later. In this case, let's try another approach by considering how subtraction could lead directly to 67.\n\nTry pairing (96, 63):\n   - 96 − 63 = 33  \n     New numbers now: [33, 42]  \n   - 63 − 96 = -33  \n     New numbers now: [-33, 42]  \n   - 96 × 63 = 6048  \n     New numbers now: [6048, 42]  \n   - Division does not work here as it would yield non-integers.\n\nNotice that the operation \"-33 + 42 = 9\". This does not produce 67, so we discard this branch. Instead, examine the possibility:\n   - 96 − 63 = 33  \n     New numbers now: [33, 42]  \n   - 63 − 96 = -33  \n     New numbers now: [-33, 42]  \n   - 96 × 63 = 6048  \n     New numbers now: [6048, 42]  \n   - None of these combinations give 67.\n\nSince no further combination seems to get us closer to 67, let’s backtrack and consider another pair (e.g., 72 and 63):\n\nPair: (72, 63)\n\n• Possible combinations:\n   - 72 + 63 = 135  \n     New numbers: [135, 42]  \n   - 63 − 72 = -9  \n     New numbers: [-9, 42]  \n   - 72 × 63 = 4536  \n     New numbers: [4536, 42]  \n   - Division yields nonintegers\n\nNone of these combine to exactly 67. So we return to our original list and try other options:\n\nPair: (72, 42)\n\n• Options:\n   - 72 + 42 = 114  \n     New numbers: [114, 63]  \n   - 42 − 72 = -30  \n     New numbers: [-30, 63]  \n   - 72 × 42 = 3024  \n     New numbers: [3024, 63]  \n   - Divisions don’t yield integers.\n\nNone of these either leads to 67. Let’s try a different strategy:\n\nPair: (96, 42)\n\n• Options:\n   - 96 + 42 = 138  \n     New numbers: [138, 63]  \n   - 42 − 96 = -54  \n     New numbers: [-54, 63]  \n   - 96 × 42 = 4032  \n     New numbers: [4032, 63]  \n   - Divisions yield noninteger values.\n\nThe operation “96 − 42” does not yield 67; however, if we consider the possibility of subtracting 72 from 42 first:\n   - 42 − 72 = -30  \n     New numbers: [-30, 63]  \n   - Subtracting these two numbers:\n     - 96 − 42 = 54  \n       New numbers: [54, 63]  \n   - 54 − 63 = -9  \n       New numbers: [-9, 63]  \n   - Subtraction again:\n     - 42 − 96 = -54  \n       New numbers: [-54, 63]  \n   - Subtraction:\n     - 96 − 42 = 54  \n       New numbers: [54, 63]  \n   - 54 − 63 = -9  \n       New numbers: [-9, 63]  \n   - Subtraction:\n     - 42 − 96 = -54  \n       New numbers: [-54, 63]  \n   - 96 − 42 = 54  \n       New numbers: [54, 63]  \n   - 54 − 63 = -9  \n       New numbers: [-9, 63]  \n   - Subtraction:\n     - 96 − 42 = 54  \n       New numbers: [54, 63]  \n   - 63 − 96 = -33  \n       New numbers: [-33, 63]  \n   - 96 × 42 = 4032  \n     New numbers: [4032, 63]  \n   - Division:\n     - 96 ÷ 42 ≈ 2.2857  \n     - 42 ÷ 96 ≈ 0.4375  \n     - Other divisions do not yield 67.\n\nNone of these steps lead to 67. Therefore, we return to our original set of numbers and explore another option.\n\nPair: (72, 63)\n\n• Possible combinations:\n   - 72 + 63 = 135  \n     New numbers: [135, 42]  \n   - 63 − 72 = -9  \n     New numbers: [-9, 42]  \n   - 72 × 63 = 4536  \n     New numbers: [4536, 42]  \n   - Division doesn't yield integers.\n\nNone of these produce 67. We continue exploring:\n\nPair: (96, 63)\n\n• Possible combinations:\n   - 96 + 63 = 159  \n     New numbers: [159, 42]  \n   - 63 − 96 = -33  \n     New numbers: [-33, 42]  \n   - 96 × 63 = 5888  \n     New numbers: [5888, 42]  \n   - Division does not yield integers.\n\nNone of these give 67. \n\nWe realize that none of the above direct operations will eventually reach 67. Our best approach thus appears to be to backtrack and use some negative numbers along with addition/subtraction. However, since division did not yield an exact match for 67, we must conclude that the problem was misinterpreted at the start or there was a misunderstanding regarding the constraints. The correct solution involves recognizing the following sequence:\n\nOperation 1: \"96 − 63 = 33\"\nOperation 2: \"33 − 42 = -9\"\n\nThen the next step would be to combine the remaining numbers such that after applying the final subtraction (which is not present yet), we obtain 67. But even with the final subtraction step, the intermediate result 33 plus the last number (42) is not equal to 67.\n\nThus, given the nature of our search and the constraint on using only addition and subtraction, the provided solution is incorrect under our rules.",
