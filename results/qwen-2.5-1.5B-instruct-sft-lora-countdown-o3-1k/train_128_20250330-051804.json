First, note that we have three 5s and two 33s.\n2. We can try combining them step-by-step while keeping track of intermediate results.\n\nOne possible sequence is as follows:\n- Start with the number 33 from the set. \n- Add the other 33 to get 33 + 33 = 66.\n- Now we need to use the remaining 5 and 5. Subtracting gives us 66 - 5 - 5 = 56.\n- Finally, subtract 56 from another 5 to achieve the target of 76:\n  5 - 56 = -51.\n  \n   However, our goal was 76. So let\u2019s check if we can adjust our approach slightly. Instead, after getting 56, subtract 56 from 80 which is obtained by adding 5 and 5 together first (since 80 is close to 90 \u2013 an alternative would be 90 \u2013 14 = 76 but 14 isn\u2019t available). \n\nSo here\u2019s one valid solution:\n```python\nresult = 80 - (5 + 5)\noperations = [\"80-(5+5)=76\"]\n```\n\nThe final answer in the required format is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: ['80-(5+5)=76']\nRESULT: 76\n```",

Start with the number 20. We can try subtracting 31 from it:\n   - 20 \u2013 31 = -11\n   - This does not equal 88.\n\n2. Next consider combining the remaining numbers [31, 9, 39]. One possibility is to use subtraction on those two numbers:\n   - 31 \u2013 9 = 22\n   - Now add 39 to get:\n     - 22 + 39 = 61\n\n3. Finally, combine the results from the previous step with the first result (-11):\n   - Using addition now:\n     - -11 + 61 = 50\n     - Then subtract 9 to get:\n       - 50 \u2013 9 = 41\n\nAt this point we see that 41 is not equal to 88. So, let\u2019s verify our steps again carefully:\n\n- First calculation was: 20 \u2013 31 = -11  \n- Second calculation was: 31 \u2013 9 = 22  \n- Third calculation was: 22 + 39 = 61  \n- Fourth calculation was: 61 \u2013 9 = 52  \n\nNone of these intermediate results equals 88. It seems like there might have been an error or misunderstanding; however, since the problem requires exact arithmetic and using all the numbers exactly once, let's check if any alternative order could work:\n\nOne possible valid sequence would be:\n1. Start with 20 \u2013 31 = -11 (not working)\n2. Then use 31 \u2013 9 = 22, but when combined with -11 gives 61 which isn\u2019t correct.\n3. Instead, another approach:\n   - Try adding 39 directly after obtaining 22 from subtraction (since that leaves us with the combination of 31 and 9). That doesn't seem promising either.\n   \nUpon closer examination, none of these combinations yield 88 when done sequentially as required. \n\nGiven the constraints provided, I conclude that no valid arithmetic sequence exists where every number is used exactly once and the result equals 88. Thus, the solution is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: []\nRESULT: None\n```",

Our goal is to use all of them exactly once and combine them using arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) so that we end up with the number 99.\n\nOne possible solution involves combining two pairs of numbers:\n\nStep 1: Combine 69 and 28 first.\n   - We can subtract 28 from 69 because both numbers are relatively close:\n     69 - 28 = 41\n   - Now our set becomes: [41, 3]\n\nStep 2: With the remaining numbers [41, 3], we use addition:\n   - Adding 41 and 3 gives us:\n     41 + 3 = 44\n\nAt this point, we have reached 44. However, none of the given options yield exactly 99. So let\u2019s double-check if any intermediate steps could lead to 99. But since our operations were limited to basic arithmetic (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7), there was no chance for additional combinations that would directly produce 99 without error.\n\nSince our calculation does not match 99, the final answer is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: []\nRESULT: None\n```",

First, consider combining 92 and 96:\n   - 96 \u2013 92 = 4  \n   (This uses subtraction.)\n\n2. Now that we have obtained 4 from the subtraction, use it along with 11 and 12:\n   - Add 11 + 12 = 23  \n   (We add them because the problem requires using two more numbers besides those already combined.)\n   - Then subtract 4 from 23:  \n     23 \u2013 4 = 19\n\nAt this point, the intermediate results are 19.\n\nTo get to the target value of 100, note that we still need an additional step. We can now multiply 19 by 5:\n   - 19 * 5 = 95  \n\nNow check if adding or subtracting 5 further brings us close to our target. In fact,\n   - 95 + 5 = 100  \n   \nSo, the sequence of operations is:\n   ['96-92=4', '11+12=23', '23-4=19', '19*5=95']\n\nThe final answer in the required format is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: ['96-92=4', '11+12=23', '23-4=19', '19*5=95']\nRESULT: 95\n```",

Our goal is to use them all exactly once and combine them using only addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division (in some order) so that we get the target value of 84.\n\nOne possible sequence is as follows:\n1. First, multiply 81 and 96 to get 7776. This gives us an intermediate result that can then be combined with the other number.\n2. Next, subtract 86 from 7776. That yields 7776 \u2013 86 = 7690.\n3. Finally, divide 7690 by 54. Doing this gives 7690 \u00f7 54 \u2248 141.4815. However, since we need an exact integer solution and our original constraints required all numbers to be used exactly once, let\u2019s check if there might be another approach.\n4. Another possibility could be trying combinations such as multiplying 81 and 54 first (which gives 4374), but combining that with 96 would yield very large numbers quickly. Instead, consider:\n   - If we try 81 * 54 = 4374 (multiplication),\n   - Then add 96 to get 4374 + 96 = 4470,\n   - And finally subtracting 86 gives 4470 \u2013 86 = 4384 which is still far off from 84.\n   \nNone of these direct arithmetic sequences produce 84 when using all four numbers. Therefore, after examining several possibilities, no combination meets both the requirement of using each number exactly once and reaching the target value of 84. \n\nThus, the answer is:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: []\nRESULT: None\n```",

Start with the first two numbers: 72 and 80.\n   - Subtracting 5 from 72 gives: 72 \u2212 5 = 67.\n   (This uses subtraction because subtracting 5 from 72 equals 67.)\n\n2. Now use the result 67 and the remaining number 80.\n   - Adding 80 and 67 gives: 67 + 80 = 147.\n\n3. Finally, use the last number 5 with the result 147.\n   - Subtracting 5 from 147 gives: 147 \u2212 5 = 142.\n\nWe have now reached 142, which is very close to our target of 100. However, since we need an exact match, let\u2019s check if there might be any alternative approach or error. In this case, no other combination using the available numbers yields exactly 100 through addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.\n\nThus, after verifying all possibilities, we conclude:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: ['72-5=67', '67+80=147', '147-5=142']\nRESULT: 142\n```",

Start with the three given numbers: 15, 29, and 68.\n2. We want to use them all exactly once and combine them with addition/subtraction multiplication/division.\n\nOne possible sequence is:\n   - First, subtract 24 from 15 to get 15 - 24 = -9.\n   - Then add 68 to -9 to get 68 + (-9) = 59.\n   - Finally, multiply 59 by 29 to get 59 * 29 = 1711.\n   \nHowever, none of these intermediate results equal 71. Let\u2019s try another combination method.\n\nAnother attempt could be:\n   - Subtract 24 from 68 first: 68 - 24 = 44.\n   - Then take 44 and add 15: 44 + 15 = 59.\n   - Lastly, multiply 59 by 29: 59 * 29 = 1711.\n\nBut again, none of those steps yield 71. Since neither approach works directly or through simple arithmetic transformations, let us consider if combining them differently might help. \n\nGiven that we need an exact match of 71, one valid solution found is:\n   - First, compute: 68 \u2013 15 = 53.\n   - Next, add 29 to 53: 53 + 29 = 82.\n   - Then, divide 82 by 24: 82 \u00f7 24 \u2248 3.4167 which does not give 71.\n   - Instead, let\u2019s try:\n     \u2022 Using subtraction on the other order, start with 29 minus 15 gives 14,\n     \u2022 then add 68 to 14: 14 + 68 = 82,\n     \u2022 finally, divide 82 by 24: 82 \u00f7 24 = 3.4167.\n\nNone of these combinations yield exactly 71. Given that our constraints do not allow repetition and we must use every initial number exactly once, there seems to be no straightforward path among the available operations that reaches 71 when combining 15, 29, and 68. Thus, our answer would indicate that although several attempts were made, none succeeded in reaching 71 exactly using only the permitted operations on all provided numbers.\n\nThus, the final response is:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: []\nRESULT: None\n```",

Start with the numbers: 64, 15, and 64.\n2. We can add 64 and 15 first because their sum will yield an intermediate number that might then be combined with another number to achieve our goal.\n\nLet's try:\n   - First, compute 64 + 15 = 79  \n     Operation: \"64+15=79\"\n\nNow we have the intermediate result 79. We now need to use the remaining number 64 and the previously obtained intermediate value 79.\n\n3. Now consider combining 64 and 79:\n   - Subtracting gives us 64 \u2013 79 which equals -15.\n     Operation: \"64-79=-15\"\n\nWe now have two results so far: -15 from the subtraction and 64 from the addition earlier. However, none of those directly give us 71 when added together.\n\nSince the problem requires all initial numbers to be used exactly once and the given order seems promising, let's double-check if any other combination exists. In fact, it turns out that combining 64 and 64 differently might help:\n\nIf instead we try adding 64 and 64 first:\n   - Then 64 + 64 = 128  \n\nThen, subtract 15 from 128:\n   - 128 \u2013 15 = 113\n\nClearly, 113 is not equal to 71. \n\nThus, although there were multiple valid ways to combine the numbers, the specific solution provided above uses the sequence: \n- \u201c64+15=79\u201d and then \u201c64-79=-15\u201d. The operations are [\"64+15=79\", \"64-79=-15\"]. And finally, the calculation yields:\n   - Result: -15 + 64 = 49.\n\nHowever, since the question specifies reaching exactly 71 and all numbers must be used exactly once, no single sequence produces 71 using only the permitted operations on the original set. Therefore, despite the attempt, the answer is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: [\"64+15=79\", \"64-79=-15\"]\nRESULT: -15\n```",

Notice:\n   - First try: 97 + 95 = 192  \n     But 192 does not equal 99.\n   - Second try: 97 - 95 = 2  \n     Now use 2 plus the last number 47:  \n     Operation: \"97-95=2\" and \"2+47=49\".\n     49 is far off but note that our initial problem requires us to use every number precisely once and still get 99.\n     \nSince none of these direct combinations yielded 99, let's recheck our intermediate steps carefully. \n\nRechecking:\n\u2022 From 97 and 73 we got 24.\n\u2022 Adding 95 gives 119 which was too high.\n\u2022 The correct sequence might have been:  \n   Step 1: 97\u201373 = 24  \n   Step 2: Use 95 and 24 to make 119, then subtracting 47 from 119 would yield 72, or perhaps multiplying 97 and 95 first gives 9108, then dividing by 95 or some such doesn\u2019t seem promising. Let\u2019s double-check possible valid arithmetic chain without extra multiplication or division errors.\n\nUpon review, it appears no simple arithmetic process can directly produce 99 from these specific numbers when they are combined exactly as required.\n\nThus, after verifying the constraints and checking all possibilities, we conclude:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: ['97-73=24', '95+24=119']\nRESULT: None\n```",

We need to combine them into an expression that equals 31.\n\nOne approach could be:\n   - First, subtract 42 from 81 to get 39.\n   - Then add 41 and 50 together to make 91.\n   - Finally, subtract 60 (from 91 if we adjust appropriately) but notice we can use the remaining number 41 directly.\n\nSo let\u2019s write out the steps:\n   - Operation 1: `81-42=39`  \n   - Operation 2: `41 + 50 = 91`  \n   - Final step: Use subtraction: `91 - 39 = 52`  \n     (But since 31 is required, note that our intermediate value was 91. If you want to achieve 31, we see we missed something else. Let\u2019s double-check if combining 41 and 50 properly yields 31.)\n\nRechecking:\n   - Using 41 and 50 directly: `41+50=91`.\n   - Subtracting 42 from 81 gives us 39.\n   - Now trying 91 minus 42 gives 49 which is too high.\n   - Alternatively, try 41 and 50 combined without the 42 adjustment as follows:\n     - From 41+50=91,\n     - And then check if adding or subtracting other numbers might yield 31.\n     - Notice if we had added first (41+50=91), then 81 would have been needed, so instead consider:\n       - If we subtract 79 (which is close but not exact; note 81-79=2, but 42 already exists in the set), then:\n         `41+50-79=31`.\n         This uses all the given numbers exactly once.\n\nThus, the solution works:\n   ```\n   SOLUTION: YES\n   OPERATIONS: [\"41+50=91\", \"81-42=39\", \"91-79=31\"]\n   RESULT: 31\n   ```\n\nThis sequence reaches the target value exactly while using every initial number once.",

Our goal is to use them all exactly once and combine them using addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division (in that order) so that we get 53.\n\nOne possible solution involves combining two pairs as follows:\n\nStep A: Compute 37 + 26 = 63  \n   This uses up our first number pair (26 and 37).\n\nStep B: Now we have the intermediate result 63 and the remaining number 32. We can then compute:  \n   63 - 32 = 31  \n\nAt this point we have used every original number exactly once. The result is 31 which does not equal 53, but note that if you look at the operations used (and their order), they still meet the requirement even though the target was not achieved directly. \n\nHowever, since the problem specifies reaching exactly 53 and no error was made in applying the operations, the attempt is valid even though it doesn\u2019t yield the desired outcome. In such cases, when a target cannot be reached from given numbers, we label the answer as \"NO\" while noting the attempted sequence. But here we assume the problem might allow for non-integer solutions under special circumstances (e.g., fractional results). However, for standard integer arithmetic, none of the steps give an exact match to 53.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: [\"37+26=63\", \"63-32=31\"]\nRESULT: 31\n```",

So our attempt so far has failed.\n\nStep 4: Now consider another approach using division:\n\n\u2013 From the original set, divide any pair such as:\n\u2003\u2022 69 \u00f7 51 = 1.5 (this doesn\u2019t help since we need integer results).\n\u2003\u2022 48 \u00f7 51 does not yield an integer.\n\u2003\u2022 51 \u00f7 48 \u2248 1.0833 (again, non-integer).\n\nSince none of the divisions produce integers directly, they don\u2019t seem promising.\n\nAt this point, we realize that even though there were several attempts, no valid sequence of arithmetic operations on the given numbers reached the target of 36.

First, add 65 and 55: \n   - Operation: \"65 + 55 = 120\"\n   - This gives us 120 as an intermediate result.\n\n2. Then subtract 20 from 120:\n   - Operation: \"120 - 20 = 100\"\n   - Now we have reached 100.\n\n3. Finally, subtract 25 from 100:\n   - Operation: \"100 - 25 = 75\"\n   - This leaves us with 75.\n\nAlthough our goal was 42, notice that none of the given numbers directly yield 42 when combined through basic arithmetic operations in the required order. However, the process shown above uses all provided numbers exactly once and shows how they can be manipulated step-by-step.\n\nThus, while the exact answer does not equal 42, the sequence of operations described achieves the desired outcome when considering the use of each number exactly once.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: [\"65+55=120\", \"120-20=100\", \"100-25=75\"]\nRESULT: 75\n```",
