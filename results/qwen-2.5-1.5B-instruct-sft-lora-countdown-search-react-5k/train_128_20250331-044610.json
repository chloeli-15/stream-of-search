Let's show the search process step by step:\nOne possible strategy is to use a Depth-First Search (DFS) guided by a **sum-based** heuristic, which computes the average of the absolute differences between each number and the target number.\nLower scores indicate that, on average, the numbers are closer to the target, making the state more promising for reaching the target via additive operations.\n\n\nCurrent State #0: 76:[5, 5, 33, 33].

Let's show the search process step by step:\nOne possible strategy is to use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) with Beam Size 5 guided by a **sum-based** heuristic, which computes the average of the absolute differences between each number and the target number.\nLower scores indicate that, on average, the numbers are closer to the target, making the state more promising for reaching the target via additive operations.\n\n\nCurrent State #0: 58:[86, 8, 22, 89].

You are a helpful assistant.\nuser\nCombine these initial numbers [29, 61, 69, 9] using only arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach the target value 92. All initial numbers must be used exactly once.\nConclude with the final result in EXACTLY this format:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\nOPERATIONS: list of string of operations performed, each string involving only 1 operation.

Let's show the search process step by step:\nOne possible strategy is to use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) with Beam Size 5 guided by a **sum-based** heuristic, which computes the average of the absolute differences between each number and the target number.\nLower scores indicate that, on average, the numbers are closer to the target, making the state more promising for reaching the target via additive operations.\n\n\nCurrent State #0: 92:[29, 61, 69, 9].

I need to combine these initial numbers [2, 25, 39, 18] using only arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach the target value 55. All initial numbers must be used exactly once.\nThought process:\n1. We have four initial numbers [2, 25, 39, 18].\n2. Our goal is to produce 55.\n3. One possible strategy is to use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) guided by a **sum-based** heuristic, which computes the average of the absolute differences between each number and the target number.\n4. Lower scores indicate that, on average, the numbers are closer to the target, making the state more promising for reaching the target via additive operations.\n\n\nCurrent State #0: 55:[2, 25, 39, 18].

You are a helpful assistant.\nuser\nCombine these initial numbers [96, 29, 13, 45] using only arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach the target value 26. All initial numbers must be used exactly once.\nConclude with the final result in EXACTLY this format:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\nOPERATIONS: list of string of operations performed, each string involving only 1 operation. For example, ['A+B=C','C+D=E'] is allowed, ['A+B+D=E'] is not allowed\nRESULT: final_value\n```\n\nassistant\nWe have these numbers [96, 29, 13, 45]. Our goal is to produce 26. Let's show the search process step by step:\nOne possible strategy is to use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) with Beam Size 5 guided by a **sum-based** heuristic, which computes the average of the absolute differences between each number and the target number.\nLower scores indicate that, on average, the numbers are closer to the target, making the state more promising for reaching the target via additive operations.\n\n\nCurrent State #0: 26:[96, 29, 13, 45].

Let's show the search process step by step:\nOne possible strategy is to use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) with Beam Size 5 guided by a **sum-based** heuristic, which computes the average of the absolute differences between each number and the target number.\nLower scores indicate that, on average, the numbers are closer to the target, making the state more promising for reaching the target via additive operations.\n\n\nCurrent State #0: 76:[30, 7, 45, 54].

You want me to combine these initial numbers [40, 9, 87, 98] using only arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach the target value 85. All initial numbers must be used exactly once.

Sorting in ascending order: [9, 40, 87, 98].\n5. Dividing the largest number by the second largest number: 98/40=2.45.\n6. Subtracting the result from the next largest number: 87-2.45=84.55.\n7. Adding the first number to the result: 9+84.55=93.55.\n8. Converting 93.55 back to original base: 93.55*10=935.5.\n9. Converting 935.5 back to initial base: [40, 9, 87, 98] = [40, 9, 87, 98].\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: ['98/40', '87-2.45', '9+84.55']\nRESULT: 935.5\n```",

I need to combine these initial numbers [2, 99, 88, 30] using only arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach the target value 85. All initial numbers must be used exactly once.\nThought process:\n1. Initial Numbers: [2, 99, 88, 30]\n2. Target Value: 85\n3. Exploring all possible combinations of operations to reach the target\nWe have these initial numbers [2, 99, 88, 30]. Our goal is to produce 85. Let's show the search process step by step:\nOne possible strategy is to use a Depth-First Search (DFS) guided by a **sum-based** heuristic, which computes the average of the absolute differences between each number and the target number.\nLower scores indicate that, on average, the numbers are closer to the target, making the state more promising for reaching the target via additive operations.\n\n\nCurrent State #0: 85:[2, 99, 88, 30].
