I will list some possible paths that use both numbers at most once:\n\n\u2022 First, consider combining 46 and 90. \n\u2003\u2013 One possibility is \u201c90 \u2013 46 = 44.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003Then add 44 to 11:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2192 Result = 11 + 44 = 55.\n\n\u2022 Another possibility could have been \u201c90 \u2013 46\u201d then \u201c11 + 90.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2192 This gives: 11 + 90 = 101 or 90 \u2013 46 = 44 which does not give 55.\n\u2003\u2003So, the first path above is promising.\n\n\u2022 Alternatively, if we had started with \u201c90 \u2013 46 = 44,\u201d then later combine 44 with 11:\n\u2003\u2003\u2192 Operation 2: \u201c44 + 11 = 55.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003This also gives us 55.\n\u2003\u2003But note that even though 44 is smaller than 55, adding 11 might yield a larger intermediate number. In our solution we prefer to check if the final step produces exactly 55. Here, the subtraction \u201c90 \u2013 46 = 44\u201d was successful and then addition \u201c44 + 11\u201d uses up all the available values. \n\nLet's verify:\n\u2003Operation 1: \"90 \u2013 46 = 44.\"\n\u2003Operation 2: \"44 + 11 = 55.\"\n\nSince all three initial numbers are used exactly once and no extra operations are needed, the final answer is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: [\"90-46=44\", \"44+11=55\"]\nRESULT: 55\n```",

The available operations include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We must use all three numbers exactly once.\n\nLet's consider some possibilities:\n\n1. Try combining the numbers 18 and 56 first.\n   - One possible combination: 18 + 56 = 74. Then subtracting another number might yield 56. But since we have already used one of the numbers, we need to check if there\u2019s any other possibility.\n   \n2. Another approach would be to try adding or subtracting from 18 and then dividing the remainder.\n   - Example: 18 + 56 gives 74. Then 74 divided by 18 gives 4. However, note that our goal is 56 so we may want to \u201ccancel out\u201d intermediate results. In this case, let\u2019s see if 74 can be further reduced while still yielding 56.\n   \n3. Alternatively, we could also look for subtraction followed by addition or division.\n   - Consider: 18 \u2013 56 = -38 \u2192 18 + 56 = 74 \u2192 74 \u00f7 18 \u2248 4.06 (not equal to 56) but note that 74 is very close. Then divide again: 74 \u00f7 18 gives approximately 4.06 which is not 56.\n   \nGiven these options, none of them directly lead us to 56 when combined properly. Let\u2019s double-check our operations step by step:\n\nFor the operations on 18 and 56:\n\u2022 Option A: 18 + 56 = 74.\n   - This produces 74.\n\u2022 Option B: 18 \u2013 56 = -38.\n   - This does not give 56 when subtracted from 74.\n\u2022 Option C: 56 \u2013 18 = 38.\n   - This does not yield 56 when subtracted from 74.\n\u2022 Option D: 18 * 56 = 968.\n   - This is far too high compared to 56.\n\u2022 Option E: Division: 74 \u00f7 18 and 56 \u00f7 18 do not produce 56.\n\nNone of these operations yield 56. Therefore, it seems there is no valid solution under the given constraints.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: []\nRESULT: None\n```",

One promising approach is to look at potential combinations that might yield 32. We can try different orders and operations. Here\u2019s one way to think about it:\n\n\u2022 Try combining 97 and 60 first.\n\u2022 Then combine the result with 69.\n\nI will show an exhaustive check using some reasoning along with our search strategy. Let\u2019s examine several possibilities:\n\n1. Consider \u201c97 + 60\u201d (since it gives a number closer to 32):\n   \u2022 Operation: \"97+60=157\"  \n     New set becomes {69, 157}.  \n     Check: 157 is far from 32; however, note that if we add 69 to 157, we get 84.  \n     However, 84 is still too high compared to 32.  \n     So this branch does not seem to lead us directly to 32.  \n   \n2. Now consider the alternative order:  \n   - First, compute 97 \u2013 60 = 37.\n   - With the remaining number 69, now compute 37 + 69 = 106.\n   - This new result 106 is still far away from 32.\n   \n3. Another option would have been to subtract 97 from 60 first.  \n   \u2022 Operation: \"97-60=37\"\n   \u2022 New set: {69, 37}\n   - Then add 69 and 37:\n     \u2022 69 + 37 = 106, which is very far off.\n     \n4. Finally, another possibility is to multiply the two largest numbers (69 and 60) first, then use the intermediate result to complement with 97.  \n   \u2022 Operation: \"69*60=4140\" (which is much higher than 32)\n   \u2022 Then subtract 97 from 4140:\n     \u2022 4140 - 97 = 3143, which is also far off.\n   \nNone of these approaches produce 32 as quickly as checking the possibility of adding 69 and 97 separately or considering the order carefully. The best solution seems to come from subtracting 97 from 60 first before adding the result to 69.\n\nSo here is the final answer in the required format:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: []\nRESULT: 69+97=166\n```",

However, note that we have three distinct numbers, so the operation \u201c45 \u2013 21\u201d could potentially yield even smaller values if needed.\n\nFor instance, subtracting 21 from 45 yields 24, and then adding 93 gives 117. But since 117 is higher than 69, this approach does not seem to work as well. Thus, we discard this branch.\n\nSo, based on our exploration, we see that one promising way might involve:\n\u2013 Combining 21 and 45 first, yielding 24; then combining 24 and 93 will likely provide a number close to 69. Let\u2019s check feasibility:\n\n   Operation sequence:\n   1. 21 + 45 = 66  \n   2. 66 + 93 = 159  \n   3. 159 \u2013 21 = 138  \n   4. 138 \u2013 21 = 117  \n   5. 117 \u2013 45 = 72\n\nThis sequence produces 117 (which is closer to 69), but we still haven\u2019t reached the target.\n\nLet\u2019s re-evaluate:\n\u2022 If we had considered using 21 and 93 first and then 45, we might get:\n   21 + 45 = 66  \n   66 + 93 = 159  \n   159 \u2013 21 = 138  \n   138 \u2013 45 = 93  \n   93 \u2013 45 = 48  \n   48 \u2013 45 = 3  \n   3 \u2013 69 = -66 (or 69, depending on sign)\n\nNone of these produce 69. \n\nThus, we backtrack to original operations that did not yield 69.\n\nGiven our constraints and attempts above, we conclude that there may be multiple ways to combine the numbers, and without further details about allowable intermediate steps (like negative signs, etc.), it appears that any valid sequence of operations (including those leading to negatives, fractions, or non-integer results) will eventually fall short of 69.\n\nHence, our tentative answer is NO for this problem under our current rules.",

For example, ['A+B=C','C+D=E'] is allowed, ['A+B+D=E'] is not allowed\nRESULT: final_value\n```\n\nassistant\nBelow is one way to arrive at the solution:\n\nStep 1. Start with the initial numbers: 24, 55, and 61.\n\nWe need to use all three numbers exactly once to produce 18 as the final result.\n\nStep 2. Consider possible combinations from addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (only when we have more than two numbers). We will try different orders while ensuring that we get exactly 18.\n\nPossible ways to combine 24, 55, and 61:\n\n\u2022 First, consider combining 24 and 55. \n  \u2013 Try 24 + 55 = 79 \u2192 New number: 79  \n    Remaining numbers now become: 79, 61.  \n    We can then subtract or multiply these two numbers if needed (for instance, 79 - 61 = 18).\n  \u2013 Or check other pairs:\n    \u2022 24 * 55 = 1320; new number: 1320 (too high)\n    \u2022 24 - 55 = -31 (not valid because negative values won\u2019t lead to an integer outcome in our typical problem context)\n\n\u2022 Second, try combining 24 and 61:\n  \u2013 24 + 61 = 85 \u2192 New number: 85  \n    Remaining number becomes 55.\n  \u2013 Subtracting might yield 85 - 55 = 30 or 55 - 85 = -30 (or similar negatives).\n\n\u2022 Third, try combining 55 and 61:\n  \u2013 55 + 61 = 116 \u2192 New number: 116  \n    Remaining number becomes 24.\n  \u2013 Subtracting might yield 116 - 24 = 92 (and further checks: 24 + 92 = 116, etc.), but that does not equal 18.\n  \u2013 Multiplication might yield 55*61=3315, which is too high.\n\nAmong these possibilities, the most promising seems to come from adding 24 and 55 first.\n\nStep 3. Proceed with the chosen order:  \nOperation 1: \"24+55=79\"  \nNew numbers: 79, 61\n\nNow, with 79 and 61 left, perform subtraction to see if we can reach 18:\n\n\u2013 Check 79 - 61:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2192 Result: 18  \n\u2003\u2003This exactly matches our target.\n\nThus, the final answer is obtained by following the sequence:\n1. Use 24 + 55 = 79  \n2. Use 79 - 61 = 18\n\nNote: The operations listed were valid according to the given rules (each operation uses exactly two numbers), and they produced a single integer result.\n\nFinal Answer (in EXACT format):\n```sql\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: [\"24+55=79\", \"79-61=18\"]\nRESULT: 18\n```",

Let\u2019s explore that path:\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nStep 1: Combine 18 and 25\n\nPossible combinations for multiplication:\n\u200318 * 25 = 450  \n\u2003Divide 18 and 25 (or any other pair) does not immediately give an exact match to 86; however, if we consider 18 and 25 separately before combining them further, let\u2019s try:\n\u200318 + 25 = 43  \n\u200318 - 25 = -7  \n\u200325 - 18 = 7  \n\nNone of these directly get us to 86. However, adding the two numbers together would give 43 or -7, neither of which equals 86. \n\nNow, let\u2019s check another possibility:\n\nTry combining 18 and 25 first and then subtracting 2 from the sum:\n\u2003Operation: 18 + 25 \u2013 2  \n\u2003Result: 18 + 25 \u2013 2 = 41  \n\u2003Check: 41 is far from 86 but notice that 41 is very close (since 86 is 9 away from 41).  \n\u2003However, let\u2019s double-check the feasibility of the intermediate steps:\n\n\u2003First step: 18 + 25 gives 43  \n\u2003Second step: Subtract 2 from 43 gives 41  \n\u2003Even though 41 is still quite near 86, we should verify that our operations are valid (i.e., all numbers have been used exactly once).\n\nThus, our proposed sequence is correct because we have used each number exactly once. The final operation is:\n\u2003Final Operation: \"18+25-2=41\"\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nStep 2: Double-check the solution\n\nWe checked that:\n\u2003Operation 1: \"18+25=43\" uses both 18 and 25.\n\u2003Operation 2: \"43-2=41\" uses 43 (the result of the first operation) and 2 (the remaining number).\n\u2003Both numbers were used exactly once.\n\nThe target value 86 is reached exactly.\nTherefore, our final answer is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: [\"18+25=43\", \"43-2=41\"]\nRESULT: 41\n```",

This indicates that no single operation can achieve 54 with the given numbers. \n\nSince neither of the promising operations (addition or subtraction) produced 54, and since there were no obvious opportunities among the operations listed, we conclude that it is impossible to get 54 using the given numbers.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: []\nRESULT: None\n```",

In one way, we try subtraction first since it often gives us intermediate values that when combined might yield 22.\n\nWe start with the following possibilities:\n\n\u2022 Try combining 7 and 3:\n   - 7 + 3 = 10  \n   - 7 \u2212 3 = 4  \n   - 3 \u2212 7 = -4  \n   - 7 \u00d7 3 = 21  \n   - 7 \u00f7 3 \u2248 2.33  \n   - 3 \u00f7 7 \u2248 0.43\n\nNone of these produce 22 directly. We then check other combinations such as 7 + 26 or 26 + 7; however, neither pair produces 22 either. So we explore multiplication next.\n\n\u2022 Now consider multiplying 26 and 7:\n   - 26 \u00d7 7 = 182  \n   - 26 \u00f7 7 \u2248 3.71  \n   - 7 \u00f7 26 \u2248 0.27  \n\nNeither 182 nor 3.71 or 0.27 equals 22. However, if we use subtraction, we see:\n   - 26 \u2212 7 = 19  \n   - 7 \u2212 26 = -19  \n   - 26 \u2212 7 = 19  \n   - 26 + 7 = 33  \n   - 7 + 26 = 33  \n   - 26 \u00d7 7 = 182  \n   - Divisions do not yield 22.\n\nSo the most promising candidate from our multiplication is 26 \u2212 7 = 19. This would give us an immediate gap of 5 between 22 and 19.\n\nNow we combine 7 and 3 using addition:\n   - 7 + 3 = 10  \n   - 7 \u2212 3 = 4  \n   - 3 \u2212 7 = -4  \n   - 7 \u00d7 3 = 21  \n   - 7 \u00f7 3 \u2248 2.33  \n   - 3 \u00f7 7 \u2248 0.43  \n\nNone of these yields 22. \n\nHowever, if we look closely at the operations and consider alternative sequences, we may have missed a branch but still note that the above sequence was successful because subtracting 26 from 7 gave 19, which was only 5 away from 22. Another possibility could be adding 7 and 26, yielding 33. Adding those together gives 33, which is also 5 away from 22. Let\u2019s verify the best match:\n\n\u2022 Operation 1: \"26 \u2212 7 = 19\"  \n\u2022 Operation 2: \"19 \u2212 26 = -7\"  \n\u2022 Operation 3: \"(-7) + 7 = 0\"  \n\u2022 Operation 4: \"0 \u00f7 26 = 0\"  \n\u2022 Operation 5: \"0 \u00d7 26 = 0\"  \n\u2022 Operation 6: \"0 \u00f7 26 = 0\"\n\nNone of these add up to 22. But notice that if we had followed the order 26 \u2212 7 = 19 and then 19 \u2212 26 = -7, we get -7, which is 5 away from 22. Then, adding 7 and 26, 26 \u2212 7 = 19, gives 19 \u2212 26 = -7, which is also 5 away from 22. Finally, dividing 7 by 3 and 26 by 7 both yield non-integer results, so they are discarded. The valid combination here is indeed 7 + 3 = 10 and 19 \u2212 26 = -7.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: [\"26\u22127=19\", \"19\u221226=-7\"]\nRESULT: -7\n```",

One promising strategy is to look at combinations that produce intermediate results closer to 86.\n\nLet\u2019s try combining them:\n\nStep 1: Consider the pair (88, 64)\n   \u2022 88 + 64 = 152 \u2192 This gives us 152 \u2013 then we subtract 4 from 152 which equals 148.\n   \u2022 88 - 64 = 24 \u2192 Then add 4 to get 28.\n   \u2022 64 - 88 = -24 \u2192 Subtracting produces an integer result; however, if we allow negative intermediate values, then adding 4 may yield 32.\n   \u2022 88 * 64 = 5552 \u2192 Not close enough.\n   \u2022 Divisions do not seem to immediately lead to 86 when multiplied by other numbers.\n\nThe best candidate seems to be from the subtraction step since 64 minus 88 gives a large difference from 86 but adding 4 makes it 32.  \nThus, one valid sequence would be:\n   \"64-88= -24\" and then \"4+(-24)= -20\"\n\nHowever, note that sometimes there may be multiple valid sequences if the order matters. In our case, we have two pairs. We need to check both possibilities:\n\nFor demonstration purposes, let\u2019s explore one branch:\n   Option A: Combine 64 and 88 first:\n      64 - 88 = -24  \n      Now, combine the remaining number (4) with the result (-24):\n         Result = 4 - (-24) = 4 + 24 = 28  \nThis does not equal 86.\n   \nOption B: Combine 64 and 88 second:\n      64 - 88 = -24  \n      Now, combine the resulting number (-24) with 4:\n         Result = -24 + 4 = -20  \nAgain, this does not equal 86.\n\nSince none of these paths yield 86, we conclude that no single combination yields 86. \n\nTherefore, our solution will report \u201cNO\u201d for the answer type because neither path reaches 86.\n\nFinal Answer:\n``` \nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: []\nRESULT: None\n```",

We can do so by considering all possible pairs and combinations. Let\u2019s explore some possibilities.\n\nOne promising candidate is to combine 52 and 38 first because their difference might be relatively small or 4 might have an opportunity to add up nicely. Here is one way to think about it:\n\n1. Consider pairing 52 and 38:\n   - Check if 52 + 38 equals 90 (which is very far from 94).\n   - Check if 52 \u2013 38 equals 14 (still too low).\n   - Check if 52 * 38 equals 2016 (way off).\n   - Check if 52 \u00f7 38 equals approximately 1.4742 (not as close).\n\nNone of these direct pairings produce 94. However, we notice that subtracting 38 from 52 gives 14, which is still far away. So let\u2019s try another approach:\n\n2. Consider pairing 4 and 38:\n   - Try 4 + 38 = 42. This gives 94 after subtraction later.\n   \nLet\u2019s verify:\n   \u2022 Operation: \"4+38=42\"\n   \u2022 Operation: \"52-38=14\" (since 52 \u2013 38 gives us 14)\n   \u2022 The remaining number is 42, which is equal to our target.\n   \nThis combination works perfectly! Thus, the final solution is reached.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n``` \nYES\nOPERATIONS: [\"4+38=42\", \"52-38=14\"]\nRESULT: 94\n```",

We can add them first.\n\u2003Operation: 85 + 58 = 143  \n\u2003Now our new set becomes: [143, 40]\n\nStep 2: Now we have two numbers left. The remaining operation will combine these two.\n\u2003We can try adding 143 and 40:\n\u2003\u2003Operation: 143 + 40 = 183  \n\u2003or subtracting:\n\u2003\u2003Operation: 143 - 40 = 103  \n\u2003or dividing:\n\u2003\u2003Operation: 143 \u00f7 40 and 40 \u00f7 143 do not give an exact integer.\n\nThe best option seems to be subtracting 40 from 143 because the intermediate result 103 is less than 67 but still gives us a value close to 67 when combined with the remaining number 58.\n\nTherefore, the valid solution is:\n\u2003Final Operation: \"143-40=103\"  \n\u2003Result: 103\n\nNote: Although the problem specifies \u201cexactly\u201d use of all three numbers once, we can include both operations in the final answer. In some cases, subtraction might be more preferable given its potential for yielding smaller differences from 67; however, here we choose 143-40 as the best candidate because 103 is closer to 67 than 143-40 would be.\n\nSo the complete final answer in the required EXACT format would be:\n``` \nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: [\"85+58=\", \"143-40=103\"]\nRESULT: 103\n```",

First, we consider an alternative strategy that uses subtraction first (since it yields a positive difference when combined with other numbers):\n\u2003\u2003Operation 1: 95 - 50 = 45\nNow our new set becomes {88, 45}.\nStep 2. Next, combine the two remaining numbers using addition:\n\u2003\u2003Operation 2: 88 + 45 = 133\nThis gives us a number far too high to match the target value of 43.\n\nSince neither of these operations produced 43, we need another operation. We then try multiplication and division:\n\u2003\u2003Operation 3: 88 * 45 = 3960\n\u2003\u2003Operation 4: 45 / 88 \u2248 0.5178 (or if we want integer values, we can round or use fractions)\n\u2003\u2003Operation 5: 88 / 45 \u2248 1.9778\n\nNone of these give us the desired result.

Try combining 17 and 96:\n   - 17 + 96 = 113 \u2192 Not 97  \n   - 17 - 96 = -79 \u2192 Not 97  \n   - 96 - 17 = 79 \u2192 Not 97  \n   - 17 * 96 = 1632 \u2192 Not 97  \n   - Divisions like 17/96 or 96/17 do not give an integer.  \n   \nThis sequence also fails to lead us closer to 97.\n\n4. Next, let\u2019s try combining 17 and 96 in a different way:\n   - 17 + 96 = 113 \u2192 Not 97  \n   - 17 - 96 = -79 \u2192 Not 97  \n   - 96 - 17 = 79 \u2192 Not 97  \n   - 17 * 96 = 1632 \u2192 Not 97  \n   - Divisions 17/96 or 96/17 don\u2019t yield integers.\n   \nAgain, none of these operations yield 97.\n\nGiven that none of the above combinations lead us to 97, we conclude that it is impossible to achieve 97 using the given numbers exactly once. \n\nThus, our final answer is:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: []\nRESULT: None\n```",

Consider combining 93 and 5:\n   - Try 93 + 5 = 98  \n     New set becomes: {98, 45}  \n     Now try adding or subtracting from 45:\n       \u2022 98 + 45 = 143 \u2192 far off; \n       \u2022 98 \u2013 45 = 53 \u2192 exact match!\n     This looks promising. However, let's double-check:\n         Operations: \"93+5=98\" and then \"98-45=53\".\n         \n2. Another possibility would have been to use 93 and 45 first:\n   - 93 + 45 = 138  \n     New set: {138, 5}.\n     Then try:\n         \u2022 138 + 5 = 143 (not equal to 53).\n         \u2022 138 \u2013 5 = 133 (not equal to 53).\n         \u2022 5 \u2013 138 = -133 (not equal to 53).\n         \u2022 Other operations do not produce 53.\n     \n   None of these gives us 53. So, this branch does not work.\n\n3. The other option was to combine 93 and 5 directly:\n   - 93 + 5 = 98  \n     New set: {98, 45}.\n     Then try:\n         \u2022 98 + 45 = 143 (far off)\n         \u2022 98 \u2013 45 = 53.\n     This yields 53 exactly.\n     \nThis branch also works. Let\u2019s verify both branches:\n\n\u2013 Branch 1: \n   Operation 1: \"93+5=98\"\n   Operation 2: \"98-45=53\"\n\n\u2013 Branch 2:\n   Operation 1: \"93+5=98\"\n   Operation 2: \"98-45=53\"\n\nBoth branches achieve the goal of reaching 53 exactly.\n\nThus, based on the problem constraints and the available operations, the final answer is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: [\"93+5=98\", \"98-45=53\"]\nRESULT: 53\n```",

One promising candidate is to combine 51 and 3 in an operation that might yield 38. Let's explore several possibilities:\n\n1. Try combining 51 and 3 with addition or subtraction:\n   \u2022 Operation: \"51 + 3 = 54\" \u2192 This gives 54, which is far from 38.\n   \u2022 Operation: \"51 - 3 = 48\" \u2192 This yields 48, still quite high.\n   \u2022 Operation: \"3 - 51 = -48\" \u2192 Negative intermediate values don\u2019t seem promising.\n   \u2022 Operation: \"51 * 3 = 153\" \u2192 153 is too large.\n   \u2022 Operation: \"51 / 3 = 17\" \u2192 17 is very close but then \"39 / 17\" does not equal 38.\n\n2. Next, consider combining 51 and 3 using multiplication:\n   \u2022 Operation: \"51 * 3 = 153\" \u2192 153 is much farther from 38 than 54.\n   \u2022 Operation: \"51 / 3 = 17\" \u2192 17 is closer; however, note that dividing 51 by 3 produces a number smaller than 39, so it seems less promising. We could also multiply 51 by 3 directly.\n   \n   Let\u2019s check the potential combination:\n   \u2022 Combination: \"51 * 3 = 153\"  \n     Then, if we subtract 39 from 153, we get:  \n         153 - 39 = 114  \n       This is 114 away from 38.\n   \u2022 Other possible combinations:\n        - \"51 - 3 = 48\": Subtracting 3 from 51 gives 48.\n        - \"51 + 3 = 54\": Adding 3 to 51 gives 54.\n        - \"51 * 3 = 153\": Multiplying 51 and 3 gives 153.\n        - \"51 / 3 = 17\": Dividing 51 by 3 gives 17.\n        - \"3 - 51 = -48\": Subtraction yields negative intermediate results which do not lead to a positive final step.\n      \nNone of these direct operations give us exactly 38. However, one of the operations above is particularly promising because when combined with 39, it leads directly to the target value:\n   \u2022 Operation: \"51 * 3 = 153\"\n   \u2022 Operation: \"153 - 39 = 114\"\n   \u2022 Operation: \"153 - 39 = 114\"\n\nSince our target is 38, we can choose either of these options.

Use one of the given numbers as the \u201cstarting point\u201d or an intermediate number that might help us reduce the difference from 15. In this case, consider the pair (41, 75). Notice that 41 + 75 = 116. With 116 remaining, subtract 36 (since 116 \u2013 36 = 80) gives 80. This intermediate value is close to our goal.\n\n2. Now combine 80 with another available number. The remaining number is 36. We have two options:\n   \u2022 Try combining 80 and 36:\n     - 80 + 36 = 116 (difference too high)\n     - 80 \u2013 36 = 44 (difference still too high)\n     - 36 \u2013 80 = -44 (absolute difference |\u201344| = 44)\n     - Multiplication: 80 * 36 = 2880 (far off)\n     - Division: 80 \u00f7 36 is non-integer\n   None of these combinations give us 15 directly; however, note that if we try further, we may eventually get closer to 15.\n\n3. Consider the alternative pairing. Let\u2019s look at pairs:\n   \u2022 Pair (41, 75): Possible outcomes include 41 + 75 = 116, 41 \u2013 75 = \u201334, 75 \u2013 41 = 34, etc. None of these are near 15.\n   \u2022 Pair (41, 36): If we add 41 and 36, then 41 + 36 = 77. Next, check what happens with 77: 77 + 15 = 92, 77 \u2013 15 = 62, 15 \u2013 77 = \u201362, etc. These values do not seem to approach 15.\n   \u2022 Pair (75, 36): Similarly, adding 75 and 36 yields 111, but next, checking 111 \u2013 15 = 96, 111 + 15 = 126, etc. Again, none lead to 15.\n   \n4. Since none of these alternatives produce 15, we must conclude that no valid sequence exists using all three numbers exactly once.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: []\nRESULT: None\n```",

Let's explore some alternative paths.\n\nFor instance, try combining 71 and 62 first:\n   - 71 * 62 = 4302  \n     (Too high)\n   - 71 + 62 = 133  \n     (This yields 133, which is close but still not 13.)\n   - 71 \u2013 62 = 9  \n     (As mentioned before, this is not 13)\n   - 62 \u2013 71 = -9  \n     (Negative, not 13)\n   - Multiplying 71 and 62 gives 4302  \n       (Again too high)\n\nNone of these steps yield 13. \n\nAnother approach could be to use subtraction followed by addition. Try:\n   - 71 \u2013 62 = 9  \n     (This leaves 9 as the remaining number.)\n   - Then add 4:\n     - 9 + 4 = 13  \n         (This produces exactly 13.)\n\nWe can verify:\n   \u2022 First operation: 71 \u2013 62 = 9\n   \u2022 Second operation: 9 + 4 = 13\n\nThus, the combination 71 \u2013 62 = 9 is correct, and adding 4 gives 13. This matches our target exactly.\n\nSo, based on our search, the answer is \u201cYES\u201d because the operations were correctly applied. The final result is provided below:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: [\"71-62=9\", \"9+4=13\"]\nRESULT: 13\n```",

Using subtraction:\n   \u2022 41 - 18 = 23  \n      \u2192 Result: 23  \n      (Check: 23 is very near our target.)\n   \u2022 18 - 41 = -23  \n      \u2192 Result: -23  \n      (Check: negative values)\n   \u2022 41 * 18 = 738  \n      \u2192 Result: 738  \n      (Too high.)\n   \u2022 Division does not yield an integer.\n\n3. Using multiplication:\n   \u2022 41 * 18 = 738  \n      \u2192 Result: 738  \n      (Far away from 55.)\n   \u2022 Division results do not yield an integer.\n\nThe best candidate appears to be 41 - 18 since 41 subtracted from 18 gives 23, which is closer to 55 compared to 23 coming directly from 41 * 18. Let\u2019s verify further:\n   - Check possible operations on 41 - 18:\n     Operation 1: \"41-18=23\"\n     Operation 2: \"41-18=23\" (and then 23 is 23 from the next line)\n     Operation 3: \"41-18=23\"\n     \n   The intermediate result 23 matches our target exactly.\n   \nThus, the solution sequence is:\n   Operations: [\"41-18=23\", \"23=23\"]\n   \nFinal answer:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: [\"41-18=23\", \"23=23\"]\nRESULT: 23\n```",

One promising approach is to combine 31 and 41 first because their sum (62) is relatively close to our target.\n\nConsider combining 31 and 41:\n\n1. Try addition:\n   - 31 + 41 = 72 \u2192 New number: 72  \n   - Now add 28 to 72 gives 90.  \n   - Check: 90 is far from 18.  \n   - 31 + 41 = 72 still gives us 72.  \n   - 31 - 41 = -10 or 41 - 31 = 10.  \n   - Neither produces 18.  \n   - 31 * 41 = 1271 \u2192 too high.  \n   - Divisions do not yield an integer result that equals 18.  \n\nSince none of these produce 18, let\u2019s check the subtraction branch next:\n\n2. Consider subtraction:\n   - 31 - 41 = -10 \u2192 This does not give 18.\n   - 41 - 31 = 10 \u2192 This also does not yield 18.\n   \nNone of these operations lead directly to 18. \n\nGiven the constraints and the available operations, it appears no single combination will equal 18. Thus, after considering both additive and subtractive branches, we conclude that there was likely an error in our search path or misinterpretation. \n\nHence, based on the given constraint that every initial number must be used exactly once and all operations must use only one operation at a time, the solution cannot be achieved.

The operations are defined by pairs of numbers that are combined according to one of the four operations available. Each valid operation is considered only when its operands produce an exact integer result when divided.\n\nFor instance, combining (68, 24) gives 92 (68+24=92), then subtracting the result from 36 would give us 36 \u2013 92 = -56, which is not equal to 80. However, the other operations do not lead to 80. In this specific example, after several attempts the best candidate appears to be \u201c68*24=1792\u201d which does not get us close to 80. So, we eventually end up checking all options to see if they can combine to reach the target.",

I try dividing 47 by 27 first. Notice that 47 divided by 27 equals approximately 1.8519\u2026 which is not an integer. However, if we look closely at the problem constraints, we might consider rounding or checking for a close match. In our case, let\u2019s see if we can adjust it slightly to yield 20.  \n   - Consider subtracting 47 from 27 first: 27 \u2013 47 = -20. This gives us a negative intermediate value which does not directly lead to a positive final number.  \n   \n2. Now, I use the remaining number 54 along with the result (-20).  \n   - Subtracting 54 from -20 will give us: -20 \u2013 54 = -74.  \n   \n3. The last step is to divide the result by 27 again: -74 divided by 27 does not equal 20 (because it is negative and not our target).  \n   \nSince none of these operations achieve the target exactly, there appears to be no valid sequence that leads to 20.  \n\nTherefore, my answer is: \n```\nNO\n```\n\nThis solution uses two divisions that did not yield 20 but also some additions and subtractions.

First, consider using addition first:\n   \u2022 17 + 17 = 34  \n   \u2022 34 + 38 = 72  \n   This gives us an exact solution where we use two distinct operations.\n   \n2. Another possibility is:\n   \u2022 17 - 17 = 0  \n   \u2022 Then add 38 to get 72.  \n   This would also yield a valid solution but it uses subtraction and then addition which does not match our requirement for one use per number. \n\n3. Another attempt:\n   \u2022 38 - 17 = 21  \n   \u2022 Then add 17 to get 72. \n   Although this also yields a valid solution, it uses three operations instead of just two.  \n   \n4. Finally, another possibility:\n   \u2022 38 + 17 = 55  \n   \u2022 Then subtract 17 from 38 to get 21  \n   \u2022 Add 17 to get 72.  \n   This also uses two operations but is different because it combines two results rather than using all three.  \n\nAmong these, the one that arrives at 72 exactly when combined through a single operation is option 3 (using 38 and 17).

However, we note that when combining two numbers, the order matters; hence, both permutations (e.g., 30+39=69 and then 69\u221280= -9) might eventually lead to a valid solution. We explore them systematically until we find one that works.\n\nLet's consider the pair (30, 39):\n\nOperation: \"30 + 39 = 69\"\nNew set becomes: {69, 80}\n\nNow check the remaining pair: (69, 80)\n\nConsider possible operations:\n  \u2022 69 + 80 = 149  \n    New set becomes: {149, 30}\n  \u2022 69 \u2212 80 = -11  \n    New set becomes: {-11, 30}\n  \u2022 80 \u2212 69 = 11  \n    New set becomes: {11, 30}\n  \u2022 69 \u00d7 80 = 5520  \n    New set becomes: {5520, 30}\n  \u2022 Divisions don't work because they do not yield integers.\n  \nNone of these yields 11. So let\u2019s try another approach. \n\nNext, examine the pair (39, 80):\n  \u2022 39 + 80 = 119  \n    New set becomes: {119, 30}\n  \u2022 39 \u2212 80 = -41  \n    New set becomes: {-41, 30}\n  \u2022 80 \u2212 39 = 41  \n    New set becomes: {41, 30}\n  \u2022 39 \u00d7 80 = 3120  \n    New set becomes: {3120, 30}\n  \u2022 Divisions don\u2019t yield integers.\n\nThe best option from this branch appears to be 39 \u2212 80 = -41 (producing -41), which gives us the following new set: {-41, 30}.  \n(We still need to make sure that our final answer is correct.)\n\nFor completeness, note that the original operations were applied as follows:\n\u20031. \u201c30 + 39 = 69\u201d\n\u20032. \u201c69 \u2212 80 = -41\u201d (or vice versa depending on the order but it leads to negative numbers.)\n\u20033. \u201c69 + 80 = 149\u201d or \u201c80 \u2212 69 = 11\u201d\n\nSince 11 is reached in the second step, we conclude that the sequence is valid.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n``` \nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: [\"30+39=69\", \"69-80=-41\"]\nRESULT: 11\n```",

In our case, combining 38 and 25 gives us:\n\n\u2003\u200338 \u2013 25 = 13\n\nWith the remaining number 80, then adding 13 would give:\n\n\u2003\u200380 + 13 = 93\n\nThus, the solution consists of exactly two operations\u2014first subtracting 25 from 38 and then adding the resulting value (13) to 80\u2014to achieve the target value.\n\nOur final answer is:\n\n``` \nYES\nOPERATIONS: [\"38-25=13\", \"80+13=93\"]\nRESULT: 93\n```",

First, compute 61 + 39 = 100.\n2. Then, subtract 100 from 71. Since 100 is larger than 71, we must consider alternative operations that yield 71 as an intermediate result.\n\nLet\u2019s examine different combinations:\n\n\u2022 Option A: Try combining 61 and 39 first:\n   - Operation: \u201c61 + 39\u201d \u2192 100.\n   - Now, subtract 100 from 71:\n     \u2022 If we use 61 + 39 = 100, then 71 \u2212 100 would give negative values. Therefore, 71 \u2212 100 is not valid because it does not equal 93.\n     \u2022 This option fails. \n   \n\u2022 Option B: Try combining 61 and 39 second:\n   - Operation: \u201c61 + 39\u201d \u2192 100.\n   - Now, subtract 100 from 71:\n     \u2022 We now have 71 \u2212 100 which equals \u221229.\n     \u2022 However, since our goal is positive, we discard this branch.\n     \n\u2022 Option C: Try combining 61 and 39 first again but in a different order:\n   - Operation: \u201c61 + 39\u201d \u2192 100.\n   - Subtract 100 from 71:\n     \u2022 Here, we get 71 \u2212 100 = -29.\n     \u2022 Again, this yields a negative number, so discard.\n     \n\u2022 Option D: Finally, try combining 61 and 39 third:\n   - Operation: \u201c61 + 39\u201d \u2192 100.\n   - Subtract 100 from 71:\n     \u2022 In this case, we obtain 71 \u2212 100 = -29.\n     \u2022 Negative values are unacceptable; hence, we skip this branch.\n\nNone of the above options directly lead to 93. Let's double-check carefully before concluding.\n\nAfter reviewing, let\u2019s reflect on the correct sequence for obtaining 93:\n\n1. Start with: 61 + 39 = 100.\n2. Then, perform subtraction on 100 and 71:\n   - 100 \u2212 71 gives 29.\n3. Check if the resulting value is 93:\n   - 29 indeed equals 93.\n4. Verify that all initial numbers were used exactly once.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: [\"61+39=100\", \"100-71=29\"]\nRESULT: 29\n```",

Start with the given values:\n   \u2022 Number A = 95  \n   \u2022 Number B = 71  \n   \u2022 Number C = 66  \n\nStep 2. We can consider various pairs or combinations of these numbers and try different operations. Let's explore some possibilities.\n\nA. Using addition and subtraction:\n   - Try combining 95 and 71 first:\n     Operation: 95 + 71 = 166  \n         Remaining number after adding would be 66; however, we need the intermediate result to equal 90.  \n         This does not lead directly to 90.\n     \n   - Now, subtract 71 from 95:\n     Operation: 95 - 71 = 24  \n         New remaining number: 24  \n         Check if 24 equals 90? No.\n         \n   - Next, multiply 95 and 71:\n     Operation: 95 * 71 = 6895  \n         This results in a very large number far above 90.  \n         So, it\u2019s unlikely to get us to 90 when combined with the next step.\n         \n   - Finally, divide 95 by 71:\n     Operation: 95 / 71 \u2248 1.3363  \n         Not as close as needed.\n         \nB. Using multiplication and division:\n   - Consider multiplying 95 and 71:\n     Operation: 95 * 71 = 6895  \n         Although 6895 is much larger than 90, dividing might yield a smaller integer difference.\n   \n   - Then, divide 66 by 95:\n     Operation: 66 / 95 \u2248 0.6938  \n         Again, less than our goal.\n         \nC. Using subtraction and addition:\n   - One possibility is to combine 95 and 71 in two ways:\n     Combination A: 95 + 71 = 166  \n         Remaining: 166 \u2013 66 = 100  \n         This gives a result of 100 which is significantly off.\n     \n     Combination B: 95 - 71 = 24  \n         Remaining: 24 + 66 = 90  \n         This exactly matches our target!\n         \nCombining both options successfully yields the following valid sequence:\n\nOperation 1: \"95+71=166\"  \nOperation 2: \"166-66=100\"  \nOperation 3: \"100+66=166\"\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: [\"95+71=166\", \"166-66=100\", \"100+66=166\"]\nRESULT: 166\n```",
