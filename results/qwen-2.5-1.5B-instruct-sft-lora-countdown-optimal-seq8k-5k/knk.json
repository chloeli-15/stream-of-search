Therefore, Henry cannot be both a knight and a knave simultaneously, which means he must be one type of inhabitant (either all knights or all knaves). This contradicts Ava's initial statement that she is a knight if and only if she is a knave, because it would mean that Ava herself is contradictory to her own initial claim.\nStep 3: Given the contradiction from step 2, we need to re-evaluate our current assumptions. However, since Ava initially stated her condition correctly based on her initial information, we can conclude that Ava indeed is a knight.\nStep 4: Now, considering Henry's claim, \"Ava is a knight if and only if Ava is a knave\", we can analyze it under Ava being a knight:\n   - If Ava is a knight, then according to Henry's claim, she must also be a knave. But this directly conflicts with Ava initially stating that she is a knight if and only if she is a knave.\n   - Thus, Henry's claim cannot hold given Ava's initial statement.\n\nConclusion: Based on these logical deductions, Ava must be a knight and Henry must be a knave.\n\nFinal Result: [Knight, Knave]\nExplained: The reasoning involved analyzing each inhabitant's initial statement and their subsequent claims, ultimately concluding that Ava's initial statement was consistent with her identity as a knight, while Henry's claim was inconsistent due to the inherent contradiction in his statement when applied to Ava's identity.",

From this, we know that William cannot be a knave (since if he were, his statement would become true), so William must be a knight. Now, let's check Daniel's statement again.

However, this creates an inconsistency because if Aria were a Knave, she would be lying about both conditions, making her status uncertain based on her own statement.\n\nBased on these analyses, we reach a contradiction in all scenarios leading to a Knave.

If Penelope is a knight, then from her initial statement, Benjamin must also be a knight. However, if Benjamin were a knight, he would contradict his own initial statement because he initially claimed to be a liar. Thus, Penelope cannot be a knight, leading us to conclude that Benjamin is indeed a knight.\n\n3. With Benjamin confirmed as a knight, we now focus on Penelope. Her initial statement is consistent with our conclusion so far, meaning Penelope is indeed a knight since no contradictions arise when combining it with Benjamin being a knight.\n\n4. Now, considering Robertyn's initial claim about Penelope being a knight and Benjamin being a knight, none of these claims contradict each other or lead to logical inconsistencies within the initial conditions set by the participants' initial statements.\n\n5.

Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Sebastian, and Aurora. Sebastian remarked, \"Sebastian is a knight and Aurora is a knave\". Aurora said, \"Sebastian is a knight or Sebastian is a knave.\" So who is a knight and who is a knave?.\nConclude with the final result in EXACTLY this format:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\\ \nRESULT: final_value\n```\nThe final_value should be statements separated by commas. For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nassistant\nCurrent State: 1_knights, 1_knaves\n1_inquirer: Me, 2_persons: Sebastian, Aurora\n1_fact: Sebastian stated \"Sebastian is a knight and Aurora is a knave\"\n2_fact: Aurora stated \"Sebastian is a knight or Sebastian is a knave\"\n\nExploring Fact #1: If Sebastian is a knight, then his statement must be true. This means both parts of his statement must be true individually, which contradicts itself (if he's a knight, it implies he's telling the truth about Aurora being a knave, but if he's a knave, he would lie about that part). Therefore, Sebastian cannot be a knight.\n\nConcluding from Fact #1: Sebastian must be a knave\n\nSubstituting Sebastian as a knave in Fact #2: If Sebastian is a knave, his statement is false. Thus, at least one part of Sebastian's statement must be false for it to be considered false overall.\n\nAnalyzing Aurora's Statement: If Sebastian is a knave, then Aurora's statement must also be false because it involves saying something could happen ('Sebastian is a knave') when it can't happen based on Sebastian being a knave.\n\nConcluding from Aurora's False Statement: Since Aurora's statement is false, we know at least one part of her statement must be false. Given her initial statement was true, the part she lied about had to be 'Sebastian is a knave'. This means Sebastian cannot be a knave, leading us to conclude Aurora must be a knight.\n\nFinal Result: Michael is a knight, Zoe is a knave, and Ethan is a knave.\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO,YES,NO,NO,NO\nRESULT: [Michael, Zoe, Ethan]\n```",

From Riley's statement: \"If Emma is a knave then Emma is a knight\" implies that if Emma is a knave (liar), her statement would be true, meaning Emma is indeed a knave.
