Let's go through the process step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Exponential Search\nWe will use a **sum-based** heuristic to guide the exponential search. The goal is to find the number of levels required to reach the target number via additive operations.\n\nLower scores indicate that, on average, the numbers are more concentrated at the target, making the search more promising at lower levels.\n\nCurrent State #0: 82:[22, 45, 12, 16].
