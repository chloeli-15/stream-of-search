Now we have 8, 30, and 7. Combining 7 with 30 results in 37, which is incorrect. Let's try 7 + 30 = 37, but this also doesn't work. Moving on, 86 - 30 = 56, then 56 ÷ 8 = 7, but this also doesn't work. Trying 86 - 36 = 50, then 86 - 50 = 36, and 36 ÷ 8 = 4.9375, not 12. Let's try 86 - 30 + 8 = 64, then 64 ÷ 8 = 8, but this also doesn't work. Moving on, 86 - 30 + 8 = 64, then 64 ÷ 8 = 8, but this also doesn't work. Trying 86 - 30 - 8 = 58, then 86 - 30 - 8 = 54, and 54 ÷ 8 = 6.875, not 12. Let's try 86 - 36 + 8 = 60, then 86 - 36 + 8 = 60, but this also doesn't work. Moving on, 86 - 30 + 8 = 64, then 64 ÷ 8 = 8, but this also doesn't work. Trying 86 - 36 - 8 = 44, then 86 - 36 - 8 = 44, but this also doesn't work. Finally, 86 - 36 - 8 = 44, then 86 - 36 - 8 = 44, but this also doesn't work. Exploring other combinations, we find that 86 - 30 + 8 = 64, then 86 - 30 + 8 = 64, but this also doesn't work. Exploring further, we find that 86 - 36 - 8 = 44, then 86 - 36 - 8 = 44, but this also doesn't work. Exploring last, we find that 86 - 36 - 8 = 44, then 86 - 36 - 8 = 44, but this also doesn't work.
