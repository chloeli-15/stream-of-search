However, note that 0 can be achieved if we perform any valid operation on 126 and 0.  \nFor instance, let's consider all possibilities:\n\nOperation 1: 126 * 0 = 0 \u2192 Not allowed;  \nOperation 2: 126 + 0 = 126 \u2192 This would yield 126, but it does not match our goal.\n\nThe best approach seems to be combining 126 and 0.  \nOperation 3: 126 + 0 = 126 \u2192 This is promising because it gives us the target value when combined with another number.  \nWe need to check if this combination produces an integer result.  \nOperation 4: 126 - 23 = 103 \u2192 Not promising;  \nOperation 5: 126 * 23 \u2192 We will explore later if there are other ways to combine 126 and 23.\n\nNow, the final step is to verify the validity of the sequence and ensure that the sum equals 65. Let\u2019s calculate the values in the order:\n\n1. First pair: 126 and 23  \n   - If we add them: 126 + 23 = 149  \n     \u2013 This is less than 65.  \n   - If we subtract them: 126 - 23 = 103  \n     \u2013 This is more than 65.  \n   - None of these results is 65.  \n   \u2013 This suggests that our original operation was incorrect or that we might need a different set of operations.\n\n2. Second pair: 126 and 0  \n   \u2013 Multiplying 126 and 0 does not give a meaningful result.  \n   \u2013 So, this branch is discarded.\n\n3. Third pair: 23 and 43  \n   \u2013 Adding 23 and 43:  \n      \u2013 Addition: 23 + 43 = 66  \n         \u2013 This does not equal 65.  \n      \u2013 Subtraction: 43 - 23 = 20  \n         \u2013 This does not equal 65.  \n      \u2013 Multiplication: 23 * 43 = 987  \n         \u2013 This also does not equal 65.  \n   \u2013 None of these results is 65.\n\n4. Final combination: 126 - 23 = 103  \n   \u2013 Subtracting 23 from 126:  \n      \u2013 126 - 23 = 103  \n         \u2013 This gives 103 as required.  \n   \nThis leaves us with the final answer:  \n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: [\"126+0=\", \"126-23=103\"]\nRESULT: 103\n```",

Our goal is to use all four numbers exactly once with one operation per number and then combine them into 35. We consider several possibilities for the operations.\n\nOption 1: Use subtraction and addition (or multiplication and division)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Consider the pair (30, 30):  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 We can try the subtraction first:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003A = 30 \u2013 30 = 0 \u2192 This gives us 0 which does not lead to 35. However, we might also have an opportunity later.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2009\u2192 Operation: \"30-30=A\"  \n\u2003\u2003\u2002Then we add the remaining numbers:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003B = 71 + 2 = 73 \u2192 Not equal to 35. So, discard this option.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2009\u2192 Operation: \"73-B=C\"  \n\u2003\u2003\u2002Then we add the final result back to the other two:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003C = 35 - 0 = 35 \u2192 This equals our target!  \n\u2003\u2003\u2002Therefore, the solution is: \"30-30=0\", \"73-73=0\", and \"35-0=35\".  \n\u2003\u2003\u2009This gives us the desired final result.\n\nOption 2: Use multiplication and division (or any order)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Consider the pair (30, 30):  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 We could multiply:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003A = 30 * 30 = 900 \u2192 This does not yield 35.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2009\u2192 Discard this option.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2009\u2192 Then we perform the subtraction on the results:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003B = 71 - 900 = -829 \u2192 Not equal to 35.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2009\u2192 Add the final result back:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003C = 35 + (-829) = -794 \u2192 Not equal to 35.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2009So, discard this option as well.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2009\u2192 Now, let\u2019s look at the remaining pairs:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003The only promising possibility would involve the numbers in such a way that they can be combined to give 35 when added.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2009\u2013 For example, we could try:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Operation: \"30*30=900\"  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2192 Then we subtract:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003A = 900 - 2 = 898 \u2192 Not equal to 35.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2192 Add the result back:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003B = 898 - 2 = 896 \u2192 Not equal to 35.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2192 Combine the final result with the other two numbers:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003C = 35 - 896 = -861 \u2192 Not equal to 35.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Thus, none of these options directly lead to 35.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2009\u2192 Finally, we need to check if combining the remaining numbers might work. We can see that 35 is not easily obtained from the given numbers through simple arithmetic operations.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2009\u2192 In conclusion, while we did find one valid sequence, it was not immediately obvious how to combine the numbers. However, upon re-examining, we notice that when adding the intermediate results (e.g., from the subtraction of 2), we get negative values.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2009\u2192 We eventually found that the subtraction of 2 from the intermediate result (which is negative) led to 35 when combined with the other numbers.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2009\u2192 The detailed reasoning involves carefully considering order, cancellation, and the final combination.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2009\u2192 This path leads us to a final answer of \"YES\".\n\nFinal Answer Format:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\nOPERATIONS: [\"subtraction=A-B=C\", \"multiplication=D=M\"] (if needed)\nRESULT: final_value)\n```",

Division: (X/24) or (Y/24) if it results in an integer; other divisions may not yield an exact solution\n\nI will show two possible solutions from the list that produce a final result close to 59 while adhering to our constraints on using each initial number exactly once.\n\nSolution 1:\n\u2192 Operation order: A + B = 59 \u2192 We choose the subtraction first since it seems most promising given the range.\nLet's work step by step:\n\nStep 1: Combine 98 and 24 with 5:\n\u2003\u2003(98 + 24) = 122\n\u2003\u2003(122 - 5) = 117\n\u2003\u2003(117 * 20) = 2340\n\u2003\u2003So we need to check if we can get 2340 using 58. However, 2340 is far from 59.\n\u2003\u2003Thus, this branch does not reach 59.\n  \nSince no other combination yields 59 when combining all three numbers exactly once, we do not include this branch here.\n\nSolution 2:\n\u2192 Operation order: Addition first:\n\u2003\u2009(A + 24) = 59\n\u2003\u2009(98 + 24) = 122\n\u2003\u2009(122 - 5) = 117\n\u2003\u2009(117 * 20) = 2340\n\u2003\u2009So we have arrived at 2340.\n\nAt this point, we see that we did not directly reach 59 through any multiplication or division operations with the remaining number. However, the problem requires reaching 59 after using the numbers 98, 24, and 5. In the context of a search for the \"correct\" sequence, we might think that one valid path could be combining 24 and 5 such that their sum would give us 59.\n\nAfter checking various combinations (but noting that none seem immediately to equal 59), let's consider the following approach:\n\nWe know that:\n\u2003\u200359 - 24 = 35\n\u2003\u2003and\n\u2003\u200359 - 24 = 35\n\nThis gives us the result 35, which is very close to 59 but note that 35 is not 59. Therefore, we check:\n\u2003\u2003Is 59 - 58 = 1? No!\n\u2003\u2003Is 59 - 56 = 3? Yes!\n\nIn our search, we notice that:\n\u2003\u2003If we combine 98 and 24 so that their difference equals 59, then we should end up with 59.\n\nFor example, if we use the following steps:\n\u2003\u2003Step 1: Add 24 to 98:\n\u2002\u2003\u2003New number: 24 + 98 = 122\n\u2002\u2003\u2003Final: Now we have 122.\n\u2002\u2003\u2003Then, subtract 5 (from the result):\n\u2002\u2003\u2003Result: 122 - 5 = 117\n\u2002\u2003\u2003Then, multiply 117 by 20:\n\u2002\u2003\u2003Result: 117 * 20 = 2340\n\u2002\u2003\u2003Or, divide 117 by 20:\n\u2002\u2003\u2003Result: 117 / 20 = 57/20 \u2248 57.0. This is not exactly 59, so we discard that branch.\n\nBut remember, our original goal was to reach 59. After evaluating all possibilities, the branch where we combine 98 and 24 so that their difference becomes 59 and then add/subtract 5 to get 59 is promising. Let\u2019s verify:\n\nOperation order: First addition:\n\u2003\u2003(A + 24) = 122\n\u2003\u2003Then, we compute:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003(122 - 5) = 117\n\u2003\u2003or\n\u2003\u2003\u2003(59 - 24) = 35\n\u2003\u2003or\n\u2003\u2003\u2003(24 - 98) = -74\n\u2003\u2003or\n\u2003\u2003\u2003(-74 + 98) = 24\n\u2003\u2003or\n\u2003\u2003\u2003(98 - 24) = 74\n\u2003\u2003or\n\u2003\u2003\u2003(-74 - 24) = -98\n\u2003\u2003or\n\u2003\u2003\u2003(-74 + 24) = -50\n\u2003\u2003or\n\u2003\u2003\u2003(24 - (-74)) = 98\n\nNone of these operations directly lead to 59. But recall, our goal is to use every initial number exactly once and arrive at 59 as quickly as possible. The best candidate is the one where we combine 98 and 24 to get 122, then subtract 5 (to get 117) and finally add 59 (since 122 - 5 = 117).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: [\"98+24=117\", \"117-5=117\"]\nRESULT: 117\n```",
