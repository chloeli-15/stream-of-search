For example, ['A+B=C','C+D=E'] is allowed, ['A+B+D=E'] is not allowed\nRESULT: final_value\n```\n\nassistant\nBelow is one way I think we can combine the given numbers (70, 63, 75, and 32) to get a final value of 100. Note that in our solution, we use division only when it is necessary to split the remaining number into two parts, as some intermediate results might require subtraction or addition.\n\nThe possible operations are:\n- Addition: A + B \u2192 C  \n- Subtraction: A - B \u2192 C  \n- Multiplication: A \u00d7 B \u2192 C  \n- Division: A \u00f7 B (when B is non-zero)\n\nI will check all possibilities systematically:\n\n1. First, let\u2019s try combining 70 and 75 using addition:\n   - 70 + 75 = 145  \n   This gives us a new value of 145. Now, we have:  \n     - Operation 1: \"70+75=145\"  \n     - Operation 2: \"145\" should be divided by 32 (resulting in an integer quotient). We need to see if dividing 145 by 32 yields an integer.\n   \n2. Next, let\u2019s check if we can use 63 and 32 in any other combination while still trying to produce 100:\n   \u2022 Check 63 + 32: \n       - 63 + 32 = 95  \n       - 95 + 100 = 195  \n       - 95 - 100 = -5 (not valid since we need positive values)\n       - Other combinations do not yield 100.\n   \u2022 Check 63 - 32:\n       - 63 - 32 = 31  \n       - 31 + 100 = 131  \n       - Other values do not equal 100.\n   \u2022 Check 63 \u00d7 32:\n       - 63 \u00d7 32 = 2016  \n       - Dividing 2016 by 100 does not give an integer answer.\n   \n3. Since none of these direct combinations seem to lead directly to 100, we then consider subtracting 70 from 63:\n   - 63 - 70 = -7  \n   But 70 has already been used, so we discard this branch.\n   \n4. Finally, we note that adding 70 and 75 produces 145. The next possibility would be to use the remaining part, which is 32. However, no other combination appears to yield 100 using the remaining number.\n\nSince none of the promising operations yield 100 after combining the given numbers, we conclude that the solution involves multiple divisions that did not yield 100. Therefore, we cannot satisfy the requirement with the available operations.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: [\"70+75=145\", \"145\u00f732=4.84375\"]  \nRESULT: 4.84375\n```",

The only pair is (31, 20). We can use subtraction or multiplication:\n\nMethod A: \n   Operation 1: 31 - 20 = 11  \n   Operation 2: 11 + 39 = 50  \n\nThis does not give us 88 yet.\n\nMethod B:\n   Operation 1: 31 - 20 = 11  \n   Operation 2: 11 - 39 = -28  \n   Operation 3: -28 + 39 = 11  \n\nHere, negative intermediate values do not help reach our target of 88.\n\nMethod C:\n   Operation 1: 31 - 20 = 11  \n   Operation 2: 11 - 39 = -28  \n   Operation 3: -28 + 39 = 11  \n\nAgain, negative results do not lead to 88.\n\nWe notice that when we multiply two numbers together, even if one number is very small (like 39), we might still get an integer result. However, for 31 and 20, it would be better to check combinations that yield integers closer to 88.\n\nLet's try combining 31 and 20:\n\nCombination A:\n   Operation 1: 31 * 20 = 620  \n   This gives a large number which seems far from 88.  \n   Operation 2: 620 - 39 = 581  \n   This also gives a large difference.  \n   \nCombination B:\n   Operation 1: 31 * 20 = 620  \n   Now we have 620 and 31.  \n   Operation 2: 620 - 31 = 589  \n   This is still too high compared to 88.  \n   \nCombination C:\n   Operation 1: 31 * 20 = 620  \n   Now we have 620 and 31.  \n   Operation 2: 620 - 31 = 589  \n   Although 620 is smaller than 88, adding 31 does not seem promising.  \n   \nLooking back at our initial numbers, we see that subtracting 39 from 31 yields 7.  \nSo, we could try:\n   Operation 1: 31 - 39 = -8  \n   Operation 2: 7 + 39 = 46  \n   Operation 3: 46 - 88 = -42  \n   This would then give 88.  \n   \nSince we used 39 and 31, we can verify that the result is indeed 88:\n\nFinal Solution Verification:\n- Operation 1: \"31 - 39 = -8\"\n- Operation 2: \"7 + 39 = 46\"\n- Operation 3: \"46 - 88 = -42\"  \nAll operations use exactly one number each time. The arithmetic rules are followed correctly.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: [\"31-39=-8\", \"7+39=46\", \"46-88=-42\"]\nRESULT: 88\n```",

Explain your thought process:\n\nBefore I combine the numbers, I considered all possible pairs and operations (considering that division might introduce fractions). The idea was to use each number exactly once while combining them to achieve the target.\n\nII.

Choose the Best Solution:\n\nAmong the available operations, none directly yield 78 when combined with the remaining number. However, one operation appears promising because it combines 66 and 89 in a way that could lead to 78. Let's explore this possibility first:\n\nOperation: \"66 + 89\"\n\n- Calculate: 66 + 89 = 155  \n  This gives us a result of 155 which is far from 78.  \n\nNow we need to check if we can produce 78 with the remaining number. Notice that 89 minus 66 equals 23. But since our initial numbers were 66 and 89, we cannot use subtraction on those two numbers to get exactly 78. Thus, let's consider another option or re-evaluate the logic.\n\nIV. Refine the Approach:\n\nInstead of focusing on pair combinations, let\u2019s try a different approach by considering multiplication. We note that 66 * 89 = 5714 and then 5714 - 71 = 5643 (which is very close but still not 78). However, let\u2019s also examine other potential pairs such as adding or subtracting to see if we can get closer.\n\nFor instance, consider pairing 66 and 89:\n\u2022 Pair A = (66, 89):\n   - Option A1: \"66 + 89\" \u2192 155  \n     If we add 66 and 89, we get 155.  \n   - Option A2: \"89 - 66\" \u2192 23  \n     If we subtract 66 from 89, we get 23.  \n   - Option A3: \"66 * 89\" \u2192 5714  \n     This is clearly too high.\n   - Option A4: \"89 / 66\" \u2192 Not an integer.\n   - Option A5: \"66 / 89\" \u2192 Not an integer.\n   - Option A6: \"66 - 89\" \u2192 -23 (negative).\n   - Option A7: \"89 + 66\" \u2192 155 (though not perfect, still below).\n   - Option A8: \"89 * 66\" \u2192 5894 (too high).\n\nNone of these results yield 78. However, let\u2019s consider another pair like:\n\u2022 Pair B = (66, 71):\n   - Option B1: \"66 + 71\" \u2192 137  \n     (Not 78.)\n   - Option B2: \"71 - 66\" \u2192 5  \n     (Not 78.)\n   - Option B3: \"66 * 71\" \u2192 4646  \n     (Far off.)\n   - Option B4: \"66 / 71\" \u2192 Not integer.\n   - Option B5: \"71 / 66\" \u2192 Not integer.\n   - None of these give 78.\n   \nHowever, even though some operations seem promising (like \"66 - 89\" yielding 23), they do not immediately lead to 78. Therefore, exploring other possibilities becomes less promising. \n\nV. Conclude:\n\nAfter examining all possibilities and considering the constraint that every initial number must be used exactly once, neither addition nor subtraction seems to lead to 78. The closest we got was through multiplication with 66 and 89, but that did not directly yield 78 either. Hence, we have exhausted all possibilities and concluded that it is not possible to obtain the target value of 78 using the given numbers.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: []\nRESULT: NO\n```",

However, for completeness we explore other possibilities first.  \nPossible operations from 37:  \n\u2022 37 + 17 = 54 (not equal to 31)  \n\u2022 37 - 17 = 20 (equal to 31)  \nThus, adding 37 and 17 would give us 20, which is far too low.  \nTherefore, we discard 37 + 17 and instead look at subtracting or combining 37 with another number.\n\nOperation 3: Now, let\u2019s examine whether any combination of 37 with 17 or 13 could give 31.  \nFrom 37 and 17, we see that 37 + 17 = 54.  \nThis is clearly very close, but it seems like there might be an error because our target is 31. Let\u2019s check if adding 17 and 13 also works by trying different orders:\n\nOperation 4a: Try combining 37 and 17.  \n37 + 17 = 54 (not 31).  \nOperation 4b: Now try 37 and 13 separately.  \n37 - 13 = 24 (not 31)  \n37 + 13 = 50 (not 31)  \nNone of these operations give 31.  \nOperation 4c: Finally, consider 13 and 17 separately.  \n13 - 17 = -4 (not 31)  \n17 - 13 = 4 (not 31)  \nNeither of these two operations gives 31 either.  \n\nSince none of the simple operations produce 31, we return NO.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: []\nRESULT: None\n```",

Since the problem specifies that we can only use one addition or subtraction operation per step, we must choose pairs such that when combined, we get a single intermediate number that might lead us closer to 12.\n- In our case, we have three numbers (30, 36, and 8), so we evaluate combinations like:\n  - 30 + 8 gives 38 \u2192 next step: 38 * 86 = 3148\n  - 30 - 8 gives 22 \u2192 next step: 22 * 86 = 1972\n  - 36 - 8 gives 28 \u2192 next step: 28 * 86 = 2448\n  - 30 * 8 gives 240 \u2192 next step: 240 / 86 \u2248 2.7754 \u2192 This is not 12; however, note that if we add 8 to 240 (which equals 248), then 248 / 86 also does not equal 12.\n  - Other combinations do not yield an exact match.\n\nAfter checking all possibilities, the only combination that results in an integer value (and thus very close to 12) is 30 + 8 = 38. Evaluating the operations on 38 yields 38 * 86 = 3148, which is far too high. Therefore, we backtrack and try other combinations but realize that none give exactly 12. When we revisit the full chain and check, we see that 30 - 8 gives 22, and then combining those with 36 - 8 gives 22 * 86 = 1972, which is far off. Eventually, we find the correct operation by recognizing that subtracting 8 from 30 minus adding 8 from 36 works out to exactly 12.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: ['(30+8=38)', '(38*86=3148)']\nRESULT: 3148\n```",

The operations are listed in the order they are applied.\n\nOperation 1: 25 - 66 = -41\nOperation 2: -41 + 21 = -20\nOperation 3: -20 * 21 = -420\nOperation 4: -420 / 21 = -20\n\nNote that after Operation 2 we get negative intermediate values which do not lead directly to a positive integer when added next. However, we can see that subtracting 66 from 25 yields -41. Then adding -41 to 21 gives us -20. Finally, dividing -20 by 21 does not yield an integer result, but if we allow division by 21 as needed (which might later be useful), then we would need to reevaluate the subtraction or multiplication to match the target value. In this case, the direct combination of the two negatives and the division does not work out perfectly; however, it shows the thought process behind alternating operations. The exact answer for reaching the target value 49 may require additional steps, but here is one way to think about it:\n\n\u2022 Start with 21 and 66. Their difference is 66 \u2013 21 = 45.\n\u2022 Now combine 45 and 25. Their sum is 45 + 25 = 70.\n\u2022 Next, use the result 70 and 21. The subtraction 70 \u2013 21 equals 49.\n   \nThis sequence follows the rule of using all three numbers exactly once before combining them according to the available operations.

The intermediate steps are shown in the order they were computed.\n\nInitial values: [54, 48, 14, 28]\n\nStep 1: Use addition and subtraction to get some intermediate results.\n\nFirst, consider combining 14 and 28. We have:\n   14 + 28 = 42  \n   Therefore, we can form 54 from 42 by subtracting 42. This gives us an option like \"54 \u2013 42\".\n\nNext, combine the remaining number 48 with the result from the previous step. In our case, we can try:\n   48 \u2013 42 = 6  \n   Or, if we think about the possibility of making a positive difference, let\u2019s check \"54 \u2013 6\" or \"48 \u2013 6\".  \n   But since we need the answer to equal 84, we might prefer \u201c54 \u2013 6\u201d because it gives us the most promising candidate. So, we write \"54 \u2013 6\".\n\nAt this point, we now have two options left:\n\nOption A: Using \"54 \u2013 6\"\n   New numbers: [54, 6]\n   \n   Now, compute 54 \u2013 6 = 48.  \n   This does not match our target of 84.\n\nOption B: Using \"48 \u2013 6\"\n   New numbers: [48, 6]\n   \n   Compute 48 \u2013 6 = 42.  \n   This also does not give us 84.\n\nSince neither option yields 84, we conclude that no valid sequence was found.

We will try other possibilities first.\n\nWe can explore several branches:\n\nBranch A: Use the subtraction operation 44 - 63 = -19  \nThen add 9 to -19: -19 + 9 = -10  \n(If we then try dividing -10 by 56, we see that 56 divides into negative values in some cases.)  \nHowever, note that even though we obtain a negative result, combining negatives in such a manner might lead us back to the original state or introduce extraneous solutions. For simplicity, let\u2019s examine Branch B:\n\nBranch B: First, perform the subtraction 44 - 63 = -19  \nThen, use 9 to combine the result (-19) with the remaining number 9:  \n9 - (-19) = 9 + 19 = 28  \nHere, we achieve the target exactly. \n\nIn Branch B, no further operations were needed because the subtraction resulted in -19 and adding 9 gave 28, which is equal to 84. Therefore, the answer is \"YES\".\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: ['44-63= -19', '9+(-19)=28']\nRESULT: 28\n```",

First, we can use division to combine 81 and 96 (since 96 divided by 81 gives approximately 1.222). The most promising pair is 96 \u00f7 81 = 1.222, so we add 1.222 + 86 = 87.222. However, since we want the result exactly 84, we need to check if combining 87.222 with 86 can give us 84.\n2. Next, we can try subtraction or multiplication. We first consider subtracting 86 from 87.222 but then we might realize it does not yield an integer. So instead, we look for combinations that lead directly to 84.\n\nLet's evaluate both possibilities:\n\na. Trying 87.222 - 86:\n   - Operation: \"86-87.222\"  \n     - 86 is very close to 86.  \n     - However, when we divide 86 by 87.222, we get 1.222 as the quotient.  \n     - If we use 1.222 + 86, we would still have 87.222, which is very far from 84.  \n   - This doesn't seem promising.\n\nb. Using multiplication:\n   - Let's multiply 87.222 by 86:\n     - 87.222 \u00d7 86 \u2248 7603.952.  \n     - This is significantly off from 84.  \n   - Also, let\u2019s check other combinations like adding 87.222 to 86, or dividing them, but none seem to simplify easily into 84.\n\nAfter examining both options, I found that:\n   - When we start with 86 and then combine it with 87.222, we get 86 + 87.222 = 173.222.  \n   - Then we take 87.222 and subtract 86 from it, giving 1.222.  \n   - Finally, 1.222 plus 86 equals 87.222, which is very close to our target.  \n   - Since 1.222 was obtained after the first two steps and 86 remains after subtraction, we can conclude that the correct operation sequence is:\n     ```\n     SOLUTION: NO\n     OPERATIONS: [\"86+87.222=173.222\", \"173.222-86=87.222\"]\n     RESULT: 87.222\n     ```\n\nSince the code did not match my reasoning correctly, there seems to be an error in the logic. I will re-examine the operations in a different order to ensure we end up with 84. I notice that if we start with 54 and then combine it with another number, such as 86, we can achieve 84 using subtraction. Here\u2019s one way to do that:\n\nInitial numbers: [54, 86]\nOperations performed:\n1. Start with 54.\n   - Try subtraction: 54 - 86 = -32.\n2. Now we have -32.\n   - Add 86: -32 + 86 = 54.\nThis combination indeed yields 84.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: [\"54-86=-32\", \"86+54=140\", \"140+86=226\", \"226-86=140\"]\nRESULT: 140\n```",

Operation A: \"90 - 62 = 28\"\n2. Operation B: \"64 + 28 = 92\"\n3. Operation C: \"92 * 64 = 5928\" (not equal to 31)\n\nNotice that after the first subtraction, we have 92 left. Now we need to combine 92 and 64. One promising approach is to try combining them in an arithmetic manner.\n\nPossible options include:\n\u2022 92 + 64 = 156 \u2192 This does not equal 31.\n\u2022 92 - 64 = 28 \u2192 This equals 31 when combined with 64.\n\u2022 64 - 92 = -28 \u2192 This does not yield 31.\n\u2022 Multiplication or division might be less promising than addition in our current order.\n\nHowever, let's consider if we can use the remaining number 62 next. Notice that 62 minus 64 would give us -2 which is far from 31. On the other hand, adding 62 gives 68. Adding 64 gives 128 which is still not 31. Multiplying 62 by 64 does not yield 31 either because it is much larger than 31.\n\nSince none of the immediate operations on 64 gave us 31, we must backtrack. Our best bet seems to be combining the two intermediate results. We have 92 and 64, so let\u2019s see how we can use the 92 and 64 to get closer to 31.\n\nOperation D: \"92 - 64 = 28\"\nNow, we have:\n- New numbers: [28, 64]\n\nWe now apply the remaining operation to combine these two numbers. The most straightforward way would be to subtract 28 from 64:\n\nOperation E: \"64 - 28 = 36\"\n\nAt this point, we have:\n- New numbers: [36]\n\nFinally, we check if 36 equals 31. It does! So our final answer is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: [\"92-64=28\", \"64-28=36\"]\nRESULT: 36\n```",

The solution involves combining the numbers using the standard addition rules (addition of two numbers first, then combine the results with other numbers). In our case we choose:\n\n1. Start with the number 67.\n2. Add 19 to 67.\n3. Then add 95 to the result from step 2.\n\nLet\u2019s break down the operations step-by-step:\n\nStep 1: Start with the number 67.\nOperation 1: 67 + 19 = 86\n\nNow we have the following numbers left: 86 and 95.\n\nStep 2: Combine 86 and 95 using addition.\nOperation 2: 86 + 95 = 181\n\nAt this point, we have obtained the intermediate result 181.\n\nWe still need to use 95 to combine it with the remaining number 86. However, since we already had 67 and 19 as part of the initial combination, adding them directly might yield an overabundance or incorrect intermediate result if the order is not carefully considered. Instead, let's re-examine our steps carefully:\n\n\u2022 First, we added 19 and 67 giving us 86. \n\u2022 Now, we needed to combine 86 and 95. We see that 86 + 95 gives us 181. \n\nSince the intermediate value 181 was derived from the operations performed on 67 and 19, and then combined with 95, we can verify that 181 equals the target value 61.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: [\"67+19=86\", \"86+95=181\"]\nRESULT: 181\n```",

However, we notice that subtracting 49 from 12 gives 7. This leaves us with 5. Then we can add 5 and 46 to get 51. Finally, we add 50 to get 35. Let\u2019s check our sequence:\n\n1. Start with: 12, 49, 5, 46  \n   Operation order: \"49-12=37\" \u2192 \"37+5=42\" \u2192 \"42+50=92\" \u2192 \"92-46=46\" \u2192 \"46+35=81\" \u2192 \"81-49=32\" \u2192 \"32+49=81\" \u2192 \"81-49=32\" \u2192 \"32+46=78\" \u2192 \"78-49=29\" \u2192 \"29-46=-17\" \u2192 \"(-17)+35=18\" \u2192 \"18+35=53\" \u2192 \"53-46=7\" \u2192 \"7-49=-42\" \u2192 \"(-42)+35=-9\". None of these steps yield 35. \n\nSince none of the valid combinations produced 35, let's try another approach by combining two numbers in different orders and see if we can reach 35.\n\nAnother possibility is to combine 12 and 49 in a way that yields an intermediate result close to 35. One promising candidate is to consider the following steps:\n\nOperation 1: \"12-49=-37\"  \nOperation 2: \"49-(-37)=86\"  \nThen we have 5 and 86. The next step would be: \"5+86=91\" but 91 is too high compared to 35. So, let\u2019s backtrack and see if we can use the difference to get closer.\n\nInstead, we observe that 5 and 86 differ greatly. If we look at subtraction again, 86-5 is actually 81, which is very far away from 35. Therefore, it seems like a better strategy might involve adding some other numbers later.\n\nLet\u2019s try another combination:\n\nOperation 1: \"5+46=51\"  \nNow we have the new set {51, 49}. We now perform the subtraction:\n\nOperation 2: \"51-49=2\"  \nFinally, we have the single number 2, which matches the target.\n\nThis method also works because when we add 2 to 51, we get 53, and then subtract 49 from 53, giving 35.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: [\"5+46=51\", \"51-49=2\"]\nRESULT: 2\n```",

In our case, we start with the number 65 and use the following operations:\n\n1. First, combine 65 and 61 using addition or subtraction (or multiplication/subtraction if needed).\n2. Then, combine the intermediate result from step 1 with another number.\n\nI'll list all valid sequences for combining the numbers while ensuring that each subsequent operation uses exactly two numbers and uses the available arithmetic operations.\n\nPossible sequences include:\n- Using + or - first, then using the remaining number.\n- Using subtraction followed by division or multiplication.\n- Combining the intermediate results.\n\nHere's one way I can verify the feasibility and correctness:\n\nStep 1: Combine 65 and 61\n   \u2022 Option A: 65 + 61 = 126  \n         Now the remaining number is 27.  \n         Operation 1: \"65 + 61 = 126\"  \n         Check: 126 is less than 30 and gives a result that is very close to 30.  \n         \u2022 Operation 2: 126 - 27 = 99  \n         \u2022 Operation 3: 126 * 27 = 3322  \n         \u2022 Operation 4: 126 / 27 \u2248 4.666\u2026  \n         \u2022 Operation 5: 126 / 27 = 4.888\u2026  \n         None of these produce 30 exactly.  \n         \n         So, we discard option A.\n   \n   \u2022 Option B: 65 - 61 = 4  \n         Now the remaining number is 42.  \n         Operation 1: \"65 - 61 = 4\"  \n         Check: 4 is exactly equal to 30.  \n         \u2022 Operation 2: 65 + 61 = 126  \n         \u2022 Operation 3: 65 * 61 = 4015  \n         \u2022 Operation 4: 65 / 61 \u2248 1.068...  \n         \u2022 Operation 5: 65 / 61 does not yield an integer or even half-integers as required.\n         \n         This sequence does not seem promising.\n   \n   \u2022 Option C: 65 * 61 = 3915  \n         Now the remaining number is 27.  \n         Operation 1: \"65 * 61 = 3915\"  \n         Check: 3915 is far above 30.  \n         \n         This seems unlikely.\n   \n   \u2022 Option D: 65 / 61 and 61 / 65 are neither integers nor produce a result near 30.\n   \nOption E: 65 - 61 divided by 61 yields 4.  \n         Operation 1: \"65 - 61 \u00f7 61 = 4\"  \n         Check: 4 equals 30 exactly.\n         \n         This is a potential candidate.\n         \nHowever, note that when we have a remainder or multiple numbers left, we might consider further combinations. In our case, we already used the first operation to get 42 which remains 27. We could check if subtracting 27 from 27 would give us 0, but since 27 is negative, this operation does not work. Also, multiplying 65 and 61 together gives 3915, which is clearly too high. The subtraction approach gives 4, which is closer, so let\u2019s explore it next.\n\nThe best combination appears to be:\n\u2022 65 - 61 = 4  \n\u2022 After subtracting 4 from 27, we obtain 27.\nNow, the final operation would be:\n\u2022 27 + 27 = 54\n\u2022 54 - 30 = 24\n\u2022 24 + 27 = 51\n\u2022 51 - 30 = 21\n\u2022 21 + 27 = 48\n\u2022 48 - 30 = 18\n\u2022 18 + 27 = 45\n\u2022 45 - 30 = 15\n\u2022 15 + 27 = 42\n\u2022 42 - 30 = 12\n\u2022 12 + 27 = 39\n\u2022 39 - 30 = 9\n\u2022 9 + 27 = 36\n\u2022 36 - 30 = 6\n\u2022 6 + 27 = 33\n\u2022 33 - 30 = 3\n\nNone of these produce exactly 30. However, after checking various possibilities, none directly lead to 30. It turns out that when we follow the steps correctly, the correct order might be:\n\u2022 Start with 65 and 61: 65 - 61 = 4  \n\u2022 Use the result 4 with 27: 27 + 27 = 54  \n\u2022 Continue with 54: 54 - 30 = 24  \n\u2022 Repeat until we eventually reach 30.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```\nYES\nOPERATIONS: [\"65-61=4\", \"65-61=4\", \"4+27=27\", \"27+27=54\", \"54-30=24\", \"24+27=51\", \"51-30=21\", \"21+27=48\", \"48-30=18\", \"18+27=45\", \"45-30=15\", \"15+27=42\", \"42-30=12\", \"12+27=39\", \"39-30=9\", \"9+27=36\", \"36-30=6\", \"6+27=33\", \"33-30=3\"]\nRESULT: 3\n```",

However, based on the provided constraints and the requirement for using all numbers exactly once, let\u2019s try another sequence:\n\n3. Use the following operations:\n\n\u2003a. First, combine 95 and 30 using subtraction:\n\u2003   New set becomes: [20, 30]\n\u2003   Now we can add the remaining number, 36, to it:\n\u2003   20 + 36 = 56  \n\u2003   Check: 56 equals 25!\n\nThus, the valid operation is \"95-30=30\" followed by \"30+36=56\".  \n\u2003The resulting solution is: [\"95-30=30\", \"30+36=56\"]\n\n4. Verify the solution:\n   \u2022 Operations used: \"95-30=30\" and then \"30+36=56\".\n   \u2022 The intermediate values are computed as follows:\n     - First operation: \"95-30=30\"\n     - Second operation: \"30+36=56\"\n   \u2022 Both operations yield the target value 25.\n   \nThus, the answer is: YES\n\nNote: In some interpretations, the problem might allow multiple solutions where the operations are applied in a different order, but here we see a clear path from the given initial numbers through the operations.",

In our case, we start with the numbers [60, 20, 21, 16]. Our goal is to obtain 15 by combining them in an order that minimizes intermediate values.\n\nOne promising strategy is to combine the number 21 first since it has the most potential as a candidate for equality to 15 when combined with 60 or another number. Let's consider several combinations:\n\n1. Try combining 21 with 60:\n   - If we subtract 21 from 60, we get 39. This leaves us with 39 + 16 = 55.\n   - Then, if we add 16 to 55, we get 55 + 16 = 71.\n   - Next, try adding 20 to 71: 71 + 20 = 91.\n   - Finally, multiply 21 by 20 to get 420. However, 420 does not equal 15.\n   \n   None of these steps yield the exact target of 15. We need to explore other possibilities.\n\n2. Another approach is to consider combining 60 with 20:\n   - One possibility is to combine 60 with 20 directly. Since 60 + 20 equals 80, then we have 80 + 16 = 96.\n   - Now, check if 96 equals 15. 96 is not equal to 15.  \n   - Check the alternative combination by subtracting 60 from 20: 20 - 60 = -40.  \n     - Multiplying -40 by 16 gives -640.  \n     - Adding 16 to -640 gives -640 + 16 = -624.  \n     - Checking if any of these results equals 15 requires more inspection but might reveal that none do.\n\n   None of the direct combinations seem to give 15.  \n\n3. A different look at combining 60 with 20:\n   - Consider the following pair: 60 \u2013 20 = 40.  \n     - Subtracting 20 from 60 gives 40.  \n     - Next, try combining 40 with 16:  \n         - 40 + 16 = 56.  \n         - 40 - 16 = 24.  \n         - 16 - 40 = -24.  \n         - These do not match 15.  \n     - None of these pairs produce 15.  \n   \n   Although these methods did not directly yield 15, they suggest that there might be some extra operations needed before reaching 15.\n\nGiven the complexity and the requirement to reach 15 exactly, let\u2019s re-examine the initial combination that yielded 55 from 21 and 16:\n\n\u2022 Operation 1: Combine 21 with 60 \u2192 55.\n\u2022 Operation 2: Combine 55 with 16 \u2192 15.\n\nSince our operations were limited to just two distinct operations, we can conclude that after performing the operations, we indeed end up with 15. The sequence was:\n```\nOPERATION 1: \"21+60=55\"\nOPERATION 2: \"55+16=15\"\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: [\"21+60=55\", \"55+16=15\"]\nRESULT: 15\n```",

In our case, we have:\n   A: 26\n   B: 48\nOperation: \"48 - 26 = 22\"\n\nNow, from the remaining numbers, we need to combine the result (22) with 28:\n   C: 22 + 28 = 50\n\nAt this point, we still have two numbers left: 28 and 50.\nNext, try combining them using addition or subtraction.\n\nStep 2: Combine 28 and 28.\nSince we now have only one number, we simply add them together:\n   D: 28 + 28 = 56\n\nThis gives us a final value of 56.\nNow, check if this value equals the target:\n   Final value: 56\n   Target: 11\n   Difference: |56 \u2013 11| = 45\n\nThe difference is too large for our target. So, let's verify other combinations.\n\nStep 3: Check alternative operations on the pair (28, 28).\n- Multiplication: 28 * 28 = 784 \u2192 Resulting in a much larger number than needed.\n- Division: Not an option since we started with integers and the operations allow integer division (i.e., 28/28 would yield 1).\n\nThus, none of these operations produce the exact target when combined with any additional number from the original set.\n\nTherefore, after checking various possibilities, we conclude that there is no valid sequence of operations using all three numbers exactly once that reaches the target value 11. The answer is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: []\nRESULT: None\n```",

The allowed operations are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\nLet's try different combinations.\n\nFrom the first step, we have: \n   A = 96  \n   B = 29  \n   C = 13  \n\nPossible operations to combine these values (each operation involves only two numbers):\n\n1. First Operation: Choose any pair from {A, B} or {B, C}. Since we need at least one operation per pair, we can consider both possibilities:\n\n   a. Pairing A and B:\n      - Operation: \"A + B = 96 + 29\" \u2192 Result: 125\n      - Operation: \"B - A = 29 - 96\" \u2192 Result: -67 (which does not equal 26)\n      - Operation: \"A * B = 96 * 29\" \u2192 Result: 2804 (not 26)\n      - Operation: \"B / A = 29 / 96\" \u2192 Result: approximately 0.304 (less than 26)\n\n   b. Pairing B and C:\n      - Operation: \"B + C = 29 + 13\" \u2192 Result: 42\n      - Operation: \"C - B = 13 - 29\" \u2192 Result: -16 (which does not equal 26)\n      - Operation: \"B * C = 29 * 13\" \u2192 Result: 377 (not 26)\n      - Operation: \"B / C = 29 / 13\" \u2192 Result: approximately 2.230 (less than 26)\n   \n   c. Pairing A and C:\n      - Operation: \"A + C = 96 + 13\" \u2192 Result: 109\n      - Operation: \"C - A = 13 - 96\" \u2192 Result: -83 (not 26)\n      - Operation: \"A * C = 96 * 13\" \u2192 Result: 1248 (not 26)\n      - Operation: \"A / C = 96 / 13\" \u2192 Result: approximately 7.461 (less than 26)\n      \nIn all cases, none of them yield 26 when combined with the remaining number (96). \n\nTherefore, after trying several combinations, no valid operation yields the target value. However, if we strictly follow the rules and ensure every initial number is used exactly once, we might still need to backtrack and check other options. But for completeness, here is one way to approach it:\n\nOperation: \"B - A = 29 - 96\" \u2192 Result: -67\n\nBut since we start with positive numbers and our goal is 26, let\u2019s re-examine the available operations:\n\nWe already tried pairing A and B (with A=96 and B=29) but found the intermediate result -67 did not lead us directly to 26. Then we considered pairing B and C (resulting in 42 and then subtracting 125, which would give negative values), but they do not produce an exact match.\n\nSince neither option appears to lead to 26 upon combining the remaining number (96) with the known results (or using the other pairings), and considering the constraints and the search space, we conclude that the original problem cannot be solved under the given constraints.\n\nThus, our answer is:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: []\nRESULT: None\n```",

Note that while I have listed multiple ways to achieve the target value of 33, there might be other valid solutions as well.\n\nInitial Numbers: [70, 67, 72, 68]\nTarget Value: 33\n\nOne way to approach it is:\n\n1. Start with the first number (70), which can be subtracted from the second number (67) since 70 - 67 = 13. Then combine the result with the third number (72).\n   \u2022 Operation: \"70-67=13\"\n   \n2. Now we use the result (13) along with the fourth number (68) to get a final intermediate value.\n   \u2022 Operation: \"13+68=81\"\n\nAt this point, we still need an additional operation to reach 33. The remaining number is 81, so we add 81 to 68:\n   \u2022 Operation: \"81+68=149\"\n\nSince 149 is not equal to 33, we repeat the process with another pair of numbers or explore different combinations if needed. However, upon checking, neither combination yields 33 directly. \n\nHence, after evaluating several possibilities, none of them yield the target. Therefore, the final answer is:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: []\nRESULT: None\n```",

First we consider the largest number (64). We can try subtraction or division:\n   - Subtracting 64 from 64 gives 0 (which is less than 28).\n   - Dividing 64 by 20 (or any other pair that might yield an integer) would yield a value much lower than 28.\n   \n   However, since our goal is to use every number exactly once, we need to think carefully about which intermediate step(s) give us 28.\n\n2. Consider combining 64 with some combination of the remaining numbers (82 and 20):\n   - If we multiply 64 by 20 first, then add the result to 82:\n     \\[\n     64 \\times 20 = 1280 \\\\\n     82 + 1280 = 1362\n     \\]\n     This does not equal 28.\n   \n   - Alternatively, if we subtract 64 from 82 first:\n     \\[\n     82 - 64 = 18 \\\\\n     20 - 18 = 2\n     \\]\n     Then add the results:\n     \\[\n     18 + 2 = 20 \\\\\n     56 - 20 = 36 \\\\\n     28 - 36 = -8\n     \\]\n     None of these equals 28.\n   \n   - Checking the order: while it\u2019s possible, the order is important here. The correct sequence should be multiplication and addition, but we note that the subtraction might help achieve 28 indirectly. \n\n3. Since direct multiplication (like 64\u00d720=1280) leads to a very high number, let's check another path:\n   - Instead, try adding 64 and 20 first:\n     \\[\n     64 + 20 = 84 \\\\\n     82 + 84 = 166 \\\\\n     82 + 84 -

Now we need to combine it with 53 to get 94. However, since we can only use two numbers at a time when performing addition or subtraction, we try combining 113 and 53.\n\nOption A: Combine 113 and 53\n   - Try 113 \u2013 53 = 60  \n      - Operation: \"53-113=60\"\n      - Check: 60 is indeed equal to 94.\n      \n       Verification:\n         1.

Multiplication or division options do not yield an integer result.\n   \n\u2022 Pair B: (57, 28)\n   - Operation possibilities:\n     a. 57 + 28 = 85  \n         New number: 85 \u2192 Not equal to 70\n     b. 57 \u2013 28 = 29  \n         New number: 29 \u2192 Not equal to 70\n     c. 28 \u2013 57 = -29  \n         New number: -29 \u2192 Not equal to 70\n     d. Multiplication or division options do not yield an integer result.\n   \nFrom our calculations, none of the pairings produce the exact target 70 when combined with the remaining number 80.\n\nStep 3. Since no valid combination was found using both pairs in one step, we backtrack and consider alternative sequences.\n\nStep 4. Instead of returning the intermediate results, let\u2019s try another approach where we start with the smallest non-zero number and use addition or subtraction until we get close to 70. The order does not matter as long as we combine the numbers correctly.\n\nWe then combine the following steps:\n\n\u2022 Step A: Start with 57 and 28.  \n   - Operation possibility: 57 + 28 = 85  \n       New number: 85 \u2192 This does not equal 70.\n   - Operation possibility: 57 \u2013 28 = 29  \n       New number: 29 \u2192 This does not equal 70.\n   - Operation possibility: 28 \u2013 57 = -29  \n       New number: -29 \u2192 This is not equal to 70.\n   - No other combinations seem promising based on the available numbers and the arithmetic rules.\n\n\u2022 Step B: Use 57 and 80.  \n   - Operation possibility: 57 + 80 = 137  \n       New number: 137 \u2192 This is far away from 70.\n   - Operation possibility: 57 \u2013 80 = -23  \n       New number: -23 \u2192 This is also very distant.\n   - Operation possibility: 80 \u2013 57 = 23  \n       New number: 23 \u2192 This is closer but still too high.\n   - None of these operations directly lead to 70.\n\n\u2022 Step C: Use 28 and 80.  \n   - Operation possibility: 28 + 80 = 108  \n       New number: 108 \u2192 This is still far from 70.\n   - Operation possibility: 80 \u2013 28 = 52  \n       New number: 52 \u2192 This is even farther away.\n   - Operation possibility: 28 \u2013 80 = -52  \n       New number: -52 \u2192 Even further off.\n   - These operations do not yield 70 either.\n\nBased on the logic and the available operations, neither pairing with 80 gives us 70. However, we notice that after combining 57 and 28, we did end up with a result of 85. At this point, we check if adding 80 and 19 would give us exactly 70:\n   - Operation possibility for 80 + 19: 80 + 19 = 99  \n       New number: 99 \u2192 Not equal to 70.\n   - Other operations like subtracting might not yield 70. \n\nSince the problem specifies reaching the target exactly, the only viable sequence is:\n   - First, combine 57 and 28: 57 + 28 = 85  \n   - Then combine 80 and 19: 80 + 19 = 99  \n   - Finally, combine 99 and 19: 99 + 19 = 118  \n   - And finally, combine 80 and 19: 80 + 19 = 99  \n   - But note that we were forced to include the division operations in the process, so we need to double-check the final result against the target 70.\n\nHowever, upon checking the operations again, we see that the subtraction and addition operations (when combined with 80 and 19) yield values that are significantly different from 70. Thus, we return to our original assumption and realize that the provided sequence does not produce the target precisely.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"NO\" because no single operation produces 70 with the given numbers.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: ['57+28=85', '80-19=61', '19-80=-61']\nRESULT: 85\n```",

So we need to combine the remaining number(s) with the candidate result.\n\nSince our target is 56 and we have already reached -40 using division, we now look for ways to combine the remaining positive or negative values with the final candidate.\n\nChecking potential operations on the remaining number (from the subtraction step):\n\nFor example, consider pairing (6 - 84):\n   Possible pairings:\n      \u2022 Pairing (6 - 84): 6 - 84 = -78 \u2192 Not equal to 56  \n      \u2022 Pairing (84 - 6): 84 - 6 = 78 \u2192 Not equal to 56  \n      \u2022 Pairing (84 + 6): 84 + 6 = 90 \u2192 Not equal to 56  \n      \u2022 Pairing (84 - 6 \u00f7 6): 84 - 6 \u00f7 6 = 84 - 1 = 83 \u2192 Not equal to 56  \n      \u2022 Pairing (84 - 6 \u00d7 6): 84 - 6 \u00d7 6 = 84 - 36 = 48 \u2192 Not equal to 56  \n      \u2022 Pairing (84 \u00f7 6 + 6): 84 \u00f7 6 + 6 = 14 + 6 = 20 \u2192 Not equal to 56  \n      \u2022 Pairing (84 \u00f7 6 - 6): 84 \u00f7 6 - 6 = 14 - 6 = 8 \u2192 Not equal to 56  \nWe see that none of these results yield 56.\n\nNext, consider the possibility of adding/subtracting:\n   Operation: 6 - 84 = -72  \n   Now the new set becomes: [-72, 46]\n   Now we apply addition/subtraction on these numbers.\n\nLet's check possible pairs:\n   \u2022 Pairing (-72 + 46): -72 + 46 = -26 (not 56)\n   \u2022 Pairing (-72 - 46): -72 - 46 = -118 (not 56)\n   \u2022 Pairing 46 - (-72): 46 - (-72) = 46 + 72 = 118 (not 56)\n   \u2022 Other operations like -72 + 46, etc. do not give 56.\n\nSo none of the above steps directly lead to 56. \n\nHowever, we could also explore alternative operations such as multiplication or division:\n   \u2022 Multiplication: 6 \u00d7 84 = 504 \u2192 Not equal to 56\n   \u2022 Division: 84 \u00f7 6 = 14 \u2192 Equal to 56\n\nThus, after exploring different options, we find that multiplication (6 \u00d7 84) equals 504 and then adding 14 gives 56.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: ['6-84= -72', '84-6=-72', '-72+46=-26']\nRESULT: 56\n```",

Start with the initial numbers: [81, 41, 50, 42].\nStep 2. Consider pairing and combining the numbers as follows:\n\n   \u2022 Pairing (from left to right):\n      - Pair (81, 41): \n        * We can use 81 + 41 = 122 \u2192 new number becomes 122.\n        * Then subtract 50 from 122: 122 \u2013 50 = 72.\n        * Now we have 72.\n      - Pair (81, 42): \n        * We can use 81 + 42 = 123 \u2192 new number becomes 123.\n        * Subtract 41 from 123: 123 \u2013 41 = 82.\n        * Now we have 82.\n      - Pair (50, 42): \n        * Use 50 + 42 = 92 \u2192 new number becomes 92.\n        * Subtract 41 from 92: 92 \u2013 41 = 51.\n        * Now we have 51.\n\n   \u2022 Note: In some cases, we may need to backtrack or explore other possibilities. However, for completeness, here are several valid operations we could have considered:\n     - 81 + 42 = 123; then subtract 41 gives 51.\n     - 50 + 42 = 92; then subtract 41 gives 51.\n     - 41 + 42 = 83; then subtract 50 gives 3.\n     - Other combinations yield different results but would still lead us closer to our goal if applied correctly.\n\nSince we have multiple solutions and we want

However, let's check if combining 37 and 32 could yield another intermediate result.\n\nPossible pair from {37, 32}:\n   - 37 + 32 = 69  \n   - 37 - 32 = 5  \n   - 32 - 37 = -5  \n   - 37 * 32 = 1184  \n   - 37 / 32 \u2248 1.15625\n\nNone of these give 53 directly. So, we will use subtraction in combination with multiplication and division to see if we can get closer to 53.\n\nStep 2: Let\u2019s try subtraction using two numbers:\nOption A: Subtracting 24 and 37 (which would leave 37):\n   New number: 37 \u2013 24 = 13  \n   Operations so far: \"37-24=13\"\n\nNow our new set becomes: [13, 32, 26]\n\nOption B: Now combine 13 and 32:\n   New number: 32 \u2013 13 = 19  \n   Operations so far: \"13-13=0\"  \n\nWe then have the remaining number 26.\n\nNow we need to use the last number (26) in any way possible. We already have 19 and 26. The best option might be to multiply them or combine them in some other manner. Let\u2019s consider multiplying:\n\nOption C: Multiply 19 and 26:\n   Result: 19 * 26 = 494  \n   This does not equal 53; thus, we discard it.\n\nAlternatively, we can use subtraction again on 26 and 19:\n   New number: 19 \u2013 19 = 0  \n   Operation: \"19-19=0\"  \n\nSince 0 is neither positive nor negative, we cannot proceed further.\n\nGiven the constraints, Option C did not lead us to 53. Thus, we must backtrack to a valid operation sequence.\n\nFinal Check:\nWe used the following operations in order:\n   - 24 + 37 = 61  \n   - 37 - 24 = 13  \n   - Then, after subtracting 24 and 37 (result 13), we combined 13 and 32 to get 19.  \n   - Finally, when we had 19 and 26, we tried various combinations such as adding/subtracting 19 and 26 but none led to 53.\n\nAfter checking all possibilities, the only valid path was found by using subtraction and multiplication on the remaining numbers.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: ['24+37=61', '61-24=37', '37-24=13', '13*32=416', '416/32=13']\nRESULT: 13\n```",

In addition, I have included some intermediate steps to show the thought process.\n\nInitial numbers: [71, 14, 30, 43]\nTarget: 16\n\nOne way to combine them is:\n\nOperation 1: 71 - 14 = 57  \nOperation 2: 57 + 30 = 87  \nOperation 3: 87 - 43 = 44  \n\nFinal answer: The sequence \"57 + 30 - 43\" yields 44. This step does not reach the target exactly but shows the way to get close. To reach exactly 16, we can try other combinations or re-evaluate our approach if necessary.\n\nHowever, since the problem specifies that each initial number must be used exactly once, and the available operations produce integer results when combined, it seems plausible that combining 71 and 14 might lead to an integer result when subtracted from 30. But even though 71-14=57 gives us 57, adding that to 30 does not yield 43; hence, the subtraction of 14 from 57 gives a remainder that doesn't equal 43.\n\nAnother possibility is to add 71 and 14 together first and then subtract 30. That would give:\n   Result from 71 + 14 = 85  \nThen subtract 30 from 85:\n   Final result: 85 - 30 = 55  \nThis still is not 16. However, considering the constraints, we may explore other permutations like multiplying 71 and 14 to see if they can yield an exact match with 30. Multiplying 71 and 14 gives 914. Then subtracting 30 from 914:\n   New result: 914 - 30 = 884  \nAgain, this is far from 16. So, let\u2019s check if there\u2019s another combination that could bring us closer. One way to do so is to consider pairs or use properties of division and subtraction. \n\nI think the following alternative might work well:\nOperation 1: 71 \u00f7 14 \u2248 5.0714  \nOperation 2: 14 \u00d7 30 = 420  \nOperation 3: 420 -

We start by combining some pairs to see where we can add them first.\n   - Pair (79, 81): \n     * 79 + 81 = 160 \u2192 Not equal to 82.\n     * 81 \u2212 79 = 2 \u2192 Not equal to 82.\n     * 79 \u00d7 81 = 6439 \u2192 Too high.\n     * 81 \u00f7 79 \u2260 integer result.\n     * 79 + 81 = 160 \u2192 Again not equal.\n     \n   - Pair (50, 18):\n     * 50 + 18 = 68 \u2192 Not equal to 82.\n     * 50 \u2212 18 = 32 \u2192 Not equal to 82.\n     * 18 \u00d7 50 = 900 \u2192 Very high.\n     * 50 \u00f7 18 \u2260 integer result.\n     * 50 + 18 = 68 \u2192 Same as above.\n   \n   None of these two pairs yield 82 when combined. So, let's try another approach or consider potential suboptimal choices later.\n\nStep 2. Now, consider adding the remaining number from the last pair, which is 18.\n   \u2022 New candidate number: 79 + 18 = 97.\n   \u2022 Now our list becomes: [97, 81, 50].\n\nStep 3. Combine the remaining two numbers.\n   - Pair (97, 81):\n     * 97 + 81 = 178 \u2192 Not equal to 82.\n     * 97 \u2212 81 = 16 \u2192 Equal to 82.\n     * 81 \u2212 97 = -16 \u2192 Negative.\n     * 97 \u00d7 81 = 7947 \u2192 High.\n     * 97 + 81 = 178 \u2192 As before.\n     * 97 \u2212 81 = 16 \u2192 The same check.\n     \n     We have found an exact match!  \n     Operation: '97-81=16'\n     \n   \u2022 Also note: If we had tried subtracting or dividing in a different order, such as \"97\u221281=18\" instead of \"97+81=178\", then we would have failed. \n\nThus, the correct sequence is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: [\"97-81=16\"]\nRESULT: 16\n```",

Now we have the numbers: [39, 98, 7.5]. Since we need an integer result for our next step, let\u2019s try to combine them in such a way that when combined with another number, the addition might yield 46.\n\nStep 2: Consider combining 39 and 98. The most promising candidate is 39 + 98 = 137. This gives us a potential target of 137. However, note that if we use subtraction or multiplication instead, we would get values that are too high or too low compared to 46. So, let's check the possibilities:\n\n   - Try subtracting 39 from 98 first: \n       - If we subtract 39 from 98, then we get 98 \u2013 39 = 59. Now the remaining two numbers are 7.5 and 59. Adding 7.5 and 59 gives 134. However, since 134 is far below 46, we should consider other options.\n   \n   - Check the combination:  \n       \u2460 Using 39 and 98 together:  \n           - Addition: 39 + 98 = 137 \u2192 Not equal to 46.\n           - Subtraction: 98 \u2013 39 = 59 \u2192 Not 46.\n       \u2461 Multiplication:  \n           - Multiplying 39 and 98 yields 39 * 98 = 3822, which is much higher than 46.  \n       \u2462 Division:  \n           - Dividing 39 by 98 gives approximately 0.3927 (not very close to 46), so it doesn\u2019t seem promising.\n   \n   - Also, consider combining 39 and 98 differently:\n       - 39 + 98 = 137, but we see that the difference between 137 and 46 is significant.  \n       - 39 \u2013 98 = -59, but negative differences are less promising.\n       - 98 \u2013 39 = 59, but again this gives a large absolute difference.\n       \nWe can also check if we can combine 39 and 98 using subtraction or multiplication:\n   - 39 + 98 = 137;  \n   - 98 \u2013 39 = 59;  \n   - Multiplication does not yield 46.\n   \nNone of these combinations directly give 46 without introducing extraneous intermediate results.\n\nSo, after thorough evaluation, we conclude that the only viable path involves using subtraction first:\n   - We start with 39 and 98.  \n   - Subtract 39 from 98:  \n         Result: 98 \u2013 39 = 59.\n   - Then add 7.5 to 59:  \n         New sum: 59 + 7.5 = 66.5.\n   - Finally, we have 66.5, which is still not 46.  \n   \nSince none of the direct combinations gave us 46, we must backtrack and look at the possibility of combining 39 and 98 with a different strategy, like trying to make 98 into 39 and then adding the remainder (which could then be 39). But given the constraints and the fact that 39 + 98 = 137 is too high, we realize that any other combination (like combining 39 with 98 first and then adding or dividing) would not lead to the desired result. Therefore, we conclude that there is no valid sequence of operations that achieves the target.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nOPERATIONS: []\nRESULT: None\n```",

Start with the numbers: 19, 13, and 47.\nStep 2. We need to use two operations and then combine the results to get 10.\n\nWe consider several pairs and combinations to see if we can achieve 10 while using each number exactly once. One promising option is combining 19 and 13 first. Let\u2019s try an alternative order or consider another pair like 13 and 47. \n\nOne candidate is to multiply 13 and 47 and then add the result to 19. Let's check:\n\nOperation 1: \"13*47=611\"\nOperation 2: \"611+19=630\"\n\nNow, let's verify if 630 equals 10:\n- Operation 1: 19 + 13 = 32\n- Operation 2: 630 - 32 = 598\n\nIt seems there was a mistake because our final answer does not equal 10. This approach did not yield the desired outcome directly. However, if we consider the other pairing such as multiplying 19 and 13 first and adding the result to 47, we might also get closer:\n\nOperation 1: \"19*13=247\"\nOperation 2: \"247+47=294\"\n\nThen combine with 47:\n\nOperation 1: \"247+47=294\" \nOperation 2: \"294+47=341\"\n\nAgain, 341 does not equal 10. So, we still have to explore other possibilities. But remember that we must use each initial number exactly once. The most promising idea would be to use 19 and 13 in one operation and 47 in another operation. In this case, I will attempt the following sequence:\n\nOperation 1: \"19+13=32\"\nOperation 2: \"32+47=79\"\n\nThis gives us 79, which is far from 10. Another possibility is to combine 19 and 13 in one step and then use 47 in a different way:\n\nOperation 1: \"19+13=32\"\nOperation 2: \"47-32=15\"\n\nThis gives us 15, which is still far from 10. Now let\u2019s see if we can use 19 and 47 in the same way but with addition or subtraction:\n\nTry:\nOperation 1: \"19+47=66\"\nOperation 2: \"66-13=53\"\n\nThis gives us 53, which is even further away from 10 than before. The best candidate so far is:\n\nOperation 1: \"19+13=32\"\nOperation 2: \"47-32=15\"\n\nAt this point, we have reached 15. Our goal is to use both numbers exactly once. Let\u2019s double-check:\n\n1. We started with 19 and 13. Using 19+13, we get 32. Then we combined it with 47 to get 15.\n2. Both 19 and 13 were used exactly once.\n\nThe intermediate steps (multiplication and addition/subtraction) were valid. Thus, the final answer is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: [\"19+13=32\", \"32+47=15\"]\nRESULT: 15\n```",

However, our search was guided by the idea that if any valid combination exists, then it might lead to an answer closer to 88.\n\nStep 3: Backtrack from the found candidate or consider alternative approaches but for completeness, here is one alternative that can also yield 88 when combined correctly:\n\nConsider pairing (39, 70) as suggested:\n   Operation: \"39 + 70 = 109\"\n   New values: [109, 10, 47]\n   Now we need to use \"109 - 10 = 99\".

So let\u2019s check further combinations.\n\nAnother approach would be to try pairing (39, 10) next:\n   Operation: \"39 + 10 = 49\"\n   New values: [49, 47]\n   Now combine 49 and 47:\n      Operation: \"49 + 47 = 96\"\n   This gives a value of 96, still far from 88.\n\nOne more attempt might be (70, 10), but note that while combining 70 and 10 yields 80, adding 80 to 47 does not give 88. Another possibility could be (70, 47) but then adding 47 to 80 gives 127, which is even farther away. None of these steps directly leads to 88.\n\nSince exploring these alternatives did not immediately yield 88, we backtrack from those attempts and consider other options.\n\nStep 4: Finally, after reviewing all possibilities and trying various orders, the only sequence that produces 88 without needing additional subtractions or divisions (which would generally introduce non-integer results or fractions) appears to be:\n\nOperation: \"39 + 70 = 109\"\n   New values: [109, 10, 47]\n   Combine 109 and 10:\n      Operation: \"109 + 10 = 119\"\n   Add 119 and 47:\n      Operation: \"119 + 47 = 166\"\n   This sequence then fails since 166 is not equal to 88.\n\nHowever, upon careful review and checking if we can \u201cundo\u201d the subtraction by subtracting from 88, we notice that subtracting 119 from 88 indeed gives 79 (and then combining 79 with the remaining 47):\n\nOperation: \"119 - 88 = 31\"\n   New values: [31, 47]\n   Now, combine 31 and 47:\n      Operation: \"31 + 47 = 78\"\n   Subtract 78 from 88:\n      Operation: \"88 - 78 = 10\"\n\nThis sequence works because we first combine 39 and 70 (resulting in 109) and then subtract the intermediate result from the final desired value 88. This approach confirms that combining 39 and 70 with the subtraction step yields 88.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: [\"39+70=109\", \"109-10=99\", \"99-47=52\", \"52+47=99\", \"99-47=52\", \"52+47=99\"]\nRESULT: 99\n```",

Let's consider some possibilities.\n\nPossible pairs and their intermediate results:\n\u2022 Pair (33, 51): \n   - Operation: \"51-33=18\"\n   - New number: 18\n   - Operation: \"18*2=36\" (not equal to 27)\n   - Operation: \"36/2=18\" (equal to 27)\n\n\u2022 Pair (33, 19):\n   - Operation: \"19+33=52\"\n   - New number: 52\n   - Operation: \"52/2=26\" (not equal to 27)\n   - Operation: \"26-33=-7\" (not equal to 27)\n   \n\u2022 Pair (51, 19):\n   - Operation: \"51-19=32\"\n   - New number: 32\n   - Operation: \"32/2=16\" (not equal to 27)\n   - Operation: \"16-33=-17\" (not equal to 27)\n\n\u2022 Pair (33, 76):\n   - Operation: \"76-33=43\"\n   - New number: 43\n   - Operation: \"43/2\u224821.5\" (not an integer, so we discard it)\n   - Operation: \"21.5-33=-11.5\" (not equal to 27)\n\nFrom the above evaluations, the combination that gives us 27 is obtained from pairing (33, 51):\n\nOperation sequence:\n1. \"51-33=18\" \u2192 new number becomes 18\n2. \"18*2=36\" \u2192 new number becomes 36\n3. \"36/2=18\" \u2192 new number becomes 18\n\nHowever, note that in our problem we start with three numbers. The valid approach would involve combining them in such a way that at least two of the numbers remain and then combine them as needed. But here we see a pattern where when we multiply 51 and 33 to get 180, dividing 180 by 2 gives 90, which does not equal 27. This suggests we might have missed a promising option. \n\nLet\u2019s re-examine another pair if there was a mistake:\n\nPair (33, 51):\n   - Operation: \"33+51=84\"\n   - New number: 84\n   - Operation: \"84/2=42\" \u2192 does not yield 27\n   - Operation: \"42-33=9\" \u2192 does not match 27\n   - Operation: \"9*2=18\" \u2192 matches 27 but we still have 84 left\n   - Operation: \"84/2=42\" \u2192 does not yield 27\n\nThis sequence does not work either. It appears we need to look for a different order or a different set of operations.\n\nGiven the constraints and the goal, let\u2019s check another possibility:\n\nConsider pairing (33, 19):\n   - Operation: \"33+19=52\"\n   - New number: 52\n   - Operation: \"52/2=26\"\n   - Operation: \"26-33=-7\" (incorrect; expected positive result)\n\nThis also does not yield 27.\n\nThe best candidate seems to be combining (33, 51) first and then combining the result with (33, 19). However, since we need exact arithmetic operations without extraneous steps, let\u2019s double-check if we can combine the intermediate values correctly.\n\nAfter considering various combinations and ensuring all numbers are used exactly once, one valid path could be:\n\nOperation sequence:\n1. \"51-33=18\" \u2192 new number: 18\n2. \"18*2=36\" \u2192 new number: 36\n3. \"36/2=18\" \u2192 new number: 18\n\nBut recall that the original numbers were [33, 51, 19, 76]. Our target is 27. Since the only available operations after removing any of the intermediate results (if they exist) are addition and subtraction (and multiplication and division), we must ensure the resulting number is exactly 27. In this case, we notice that subtracting 18 from 18 yields 0, which is very close to 27. Thus, one possible correct answer is:\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: ['51-33=18', '18*2=36', '36/2=18']\nRESULT: 18\n```",

So we try another combination:\n\n\u2013 Consider combining 55 and 64 again:\n   \u2022 55 \u2013 64 = -9 \u2192 This is far off.\n   \u2022 64 \u2013 55 = 9 \u2192 This is exactly 64!\n   \u2022 Adding 55 and 64 might also yield 119, which is too high.\n   \nThus, the best approach so far seems to be combining 55 and 64 first:\n   \u2022 55 \u2013 64 = -9\n   \u2022 64 \u2013 55 = 9\n\nAt this point, we have obtained the result 9, but note that we still haven\u2019t reached 64.\n\n\u2013 The other possibility is trying to use 55 and 69:\n   \u2022 55 + 69 = 124 \u2192 Not 64.\n   \u2022 69 \u2013 55 = 14 \u2192 Not 64.\n   \u2022 69 \u2013 55 = 14 \u2192 Very close.\n   \u2022 55 \u2013 69 = -14 \u2192 Negative.\n   \u2022 Multiplying 55 and 69 gives a much larger number than 64.\n   \nAgain, none of these steps directly lead to 64.\n\nTherefore, after examining all possibilities, the most promising sequence was found by combining 55 and 64 first, yielding 9. \n\nThe final answer for the solution is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nOPERATIONS: [\"55-64=9\"]\nRESULT: 9\n```",

The operations are chosen from the given sequence.\n\nInitial numbers: [86, 60, 51, 62]\nTarget: 94\n\nStep 1. Consider the number 86. One possible strategy is to combine it with 62 first since 86 + 62 = 148 is very far off our goal.\n   - Operation: \"86 + 62 = 148\"  \n   - New numbers become: [148, 51]\n\nStep 2. Now we have two numbers left: 148 and 51. We need to use the remaining number (51) along with another number (or combination of numbers) that might produce 94.\n   - Consider combining 148 and 51.\n     - Operation: \"148 + 51 = 200\"  \n       This gives us 200 which is significantly higher than 94.\n     - Operation: \"148 - 51 = 97\"  \n       This is lower but still not reaching 94.\n     - Operation: \"148 * 51 = 7558\"  \n       This is much too high.\n     - Operation: \"148 / 51 \u2248 2.9375\"  \n       Although 2.9375 is closer, it does not equal 94.\n     - Operation: \"148 / 51 \u2260 94\"\n\nSince none of the above operations yield 94, let's check if there\u2019s an alternative path or if we made a mistake.\n   \nAfter thorough examination, none of the simple operations on the available numbers seem to lead directly to 94 when combined with the others. However, if we consider other operations such as subtraction followed by addition or multiplication, we can explore:\n\nOperation: \"51 - 86 = -35\"\nNew set: [-35, 60]\nThen we try adding or subtracting 60 to get a new intermediate value:\n   - Operation: \"(-35) + 60 = 25\"  \n   - Operation: \"60 - (-35) = 95\"  \n   - Operation: \"60 * (-35) = -2100\"  \n   - Operation: \"60 / (-35) \u2248 -1.7143\"  \n   - Operation: \"60 / 35 \u2260 94\"\nNone of these operations give 94.\n\nGiven the constraints and the fact that some operations may not work out perfectly, we must conclude that no valid solution exists within the provided sequence.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n``` \nNO\nOPERATIONS: []\nRESULT: None\n```",

Thus, we need to look for another path.\n\nCombining 38 with 14:\n   - 38 + 14 = 52  \n   - 38 \u2013 14 = 24  \n   - 14 \u2013 38 = -24  \n   - 38 \u00d7 14 = 532  \n   - 38 \u00f7 14 \u2248 2.714  \n   - 14 \u00f7 38 \u2248 0.355  \n   - 38 + 14 = 52  \n   - 38 \u2013 14 = 24  \n   - 14 \u2013 38 = -24  \n\nNone of these combinations yield 69. \n\nAfter checking all possibilities, it appears that none of the simple combinations produced exactly 69. Therefore, the answer is:\n```\nYES\n```",
