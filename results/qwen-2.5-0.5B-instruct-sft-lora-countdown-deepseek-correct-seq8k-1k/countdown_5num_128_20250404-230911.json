You are a helpful assistant.\nuser\nCombine these initial numbers [65, 9, 49, 22, 21] using only arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach the target value 45. All initial numbers must be used exactly once.\nConclude with the final result in EXACTLY this format:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\nOPERATIONS: list of string of operations performed, each string involving only 1 operation. For example, ['A+B=C','C+D=E'] is allowed, ['A+B+D=E'] is not allowed\nRESULT: final_value\n```\n\nassistant\nWe have these numbers [65, 9, 49, 22, 21]. Our goal is to produce 45. Let's show the search process step by step:\nOne possible strategy is to use a Depth-First Search (DFS) guided by a **sum-based** heuristic, which computes the average of the absolute differences between each number and the target number.\nLower scores indicate that, on average, the numbers are closer to the target, making the state more promising for reaching the target via additive operations.\n\n\nCurrent State #0: 45:[65, 9, 49, 22, 21].

All numbers must be distinct and between 1 and 80 inclusive.\nOUTPUT: list of integers, each integer equal to the result of applying the operations to produce the final number. If no solution is found, return an empty list [].\nALGORITHM: \n1. Sort the numbers in ascending order.\n2. Use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) guided by a **sum-based** heuristic, which computes the average of the absolute differences between each number and the target number.\n3. Expand nodes at current level based on the sum of the absolute differences between each number and the target number.\n4. Select next node to expand based on heuristic value. If two nodes have the same heuristic value, select the one with the lowest number at current level first.\n5. Expand next node at current level. If at each level, all numbers at that level are already at their target number, return the list of numbers at that level as the solution.\n6. If no solution is found after expanding all levels, return an empty list [].\n\nCurrent State #0: 93:[72, 7, 11, 62, 21].
