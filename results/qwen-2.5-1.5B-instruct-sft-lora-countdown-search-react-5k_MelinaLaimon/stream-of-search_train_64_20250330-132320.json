Let's show the search process step by step:\nOne possible strategy is to use a Depth-First Search (DFS) guided by a **sum-based** heuristic, which computes the average of the absolute differences between each number and the target number.\nLower scores indicate that, on average, the numbers are closer to the target, making the state more promising for reaching the target via additive operations.\n\n\nCurrent State #0: 76:[5, 5, 33, 33].

Let's show the search process step by step:\nOne possible strategy is to use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) with Beam Size 5 guided by a **sum-based** heuristic, which computes the average of the absolute differences between each number and the target number.\nLower scores indicate that, on average, the numbers are closer to the target, making the state more promising for reaching the target via additive operations.\n\n\nCurrent State #0: 58:[86, 8, 22, 89].

Let's explore all possible combinations of these numbers using different arithmetic operations.\n4. We'll use a depth-first search (DFS) guided by a **sum-based** heuristic, which computes the average of the absolute differences between each number and the target number.\nLower scores indicate that, on average, the numbers are closer to the target, making the state more promising for reaching the target via additive operations.\n\n\nCurrent State #0: 72:[87, 45, 50, 47].

All initial numbers must be used exactly once.\nConclude with the final result in EXACTLY this format:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\nOPERATIONS: list of string of operations performed, each string involving only 1 operation.

I need to combine these initial numbers [2, 25, 39, 18] using only arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach the target value 55. All initial numbers must be used exactly once.\nThought process:\n1. We have four initial numbers [2, 25, 39, 18].\n2. Our goal is to produce 55.\n3. One possible strategy is to use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) guided by a **sum-based** heuristic, which computes the average of the absolute differences between each number and the target number.\n4. Lower scores indicate that, on average, the numbers are closer to the target, making the state more promising for reaching the target via additive operations.\n\n\nCurrent State #0: 55:[2, 25, 39, 18].
