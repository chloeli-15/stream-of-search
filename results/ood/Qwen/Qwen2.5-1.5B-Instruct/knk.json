For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nystem\nLet's analyze the statements made by Michael and Jacob to determine who is a knight and who is a knave.\n\n1. **Michael's Statement:** \"Jacob is a knave.\"\n   - If Michael were a knight (truth-teller), then his statement would be true, meaning Jacob is indeed a knave.\n   - However, if Michael were a knave (liar), then his statement would be false, meaning Jacob is not a knave, so he must be a knight.\n\n2. **Jacob's Statement:** \"Michael is a knave if and only if Michael is a knight.\"\n   - This statement can be broken down into two parts:\n     a) \"If Michael is a knight, then Michael is a knave.\"\n     b) \"If Michael is a knave, then Michael is a knight.\"\n\n3. **Analyze Jacob's Statement:**\n   - **Case 1: Michael is a knight.** \n     - According to part (a), if Michael is a knight, then Michael is a knave.\n     - But according to the rest of Jacob's statement, \"if Michael is a knight, then Michael is a knave\" being true means Michael cannot be both a knight and a knave simultaneously. This creates a contradiction because it implies that Michael cannot exist as a knight at all. Therefore, Michael cannot be a knight.\n   - Since Michael cannot be a knight if Jacob's first part holds, we need to check the second part of Jacob's statement.\n   \n   - **Case 2: Michael is a knave.**\n     - According to part (b), if Michael is a knave, then Michael is a knight.\n     - But Jacob's statement says that if Michael is a knave, then Michael is a knight, which is directly contradictory to the fact that Michael is a knave. Therefore, Jacob's second part also leads to a contradiction.\n\nSince neither case satisfies Jacob\u2019s statement without creating logical inconsistencies, we conclude:\n\n- Michael cannot be a knight or a knave based on Jacob's statement alone.\n- Jacob\u2019s statement about Michael\u2019s character contradicts itself when Michael is assumed either way, making his own assertion impossible under any conditions.\n\nGiven these contradictions, there seems to be an inconsistency in the provided information or assumptions.

Thus, Liam would say \u201cI am a knight,\u201d but since he\u2019s actually a knave, his statement is a lie.\n        - Now consider Benjamin's statement: \"Liam is a knight or Liam is a knave.\" Since Liam is a knave, both parts of the disjunction are false. However, Benjamin lies about the whole statement being true. Therefore, Benjamin's statement is also a lie when interpreted literally because if L were true, Liam would indeed be a knight which contradicts the fact that he is a knave.

This contradicts the fact that there can't be two contradictory statuses (knight and knave) for the same person at the same time. Therefore, Joseph cannot be telling the truth.\n   - If Joseph were lying, then one part or both parts of his statement must be false. Since he said \"Samuel is a knight,\" it could be possible that Samuel is indeed a knight. However, if we assume Samuel is a knight, then \"Samuel is a knave\" must also be false because a knight always tells the truth. This means Samuel is not a knave. But now we have a contradiction because if Samuel is a knight, Joseph's statement \"Samuel is a knave\" being false implies Samuel is not a knave. Thus, Joseph's statement must be false, meaning Samuel is not a knight.\n\n2. **Samuel's Statement**: \"If and only if Joseph is a knight, Joseph is a knave.\"\n   - The phrase \"if and only if\" (\\(\\iff\\)) indicates a biconditional relationship, meaning the statement holds true under two conditions:\n     1.

Therefore, both parts of his statement (that Abigail is a knave and that she is also a knight) cannot both be true simultaneously. This means there is an inconsistency because a person can't be both a knave and a knight at the same time.\n   - If Daniel is a knave, his statement must be false.

In this case, we need to consider other possibilities for Abigail.\n\n2. **Abigail's statement**: \"Daniel is a knight or Daniel is a knave.\"\n   - If Abigail is a knight, her statement must be true. Therefore, Daniel must indeed be either a knight or a knave. However, since Daniel could also be a knave as analyzed above, this part does not provide enough information to definitively determine whether Daniel is a knight or a knave.\n   - If Abigail is a knave, her statement must be false.

Samuel is a knave (true).\n    2. Samuel is a knight (true).\n\nIf Samuel is a knave, then the first part of Daniel's statement (\"Samuel is a knave\") would be false, which contradicts the fact that it's stated as true. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\nIf Samuel is a knight, then the second part of Daniel's statement (\"Samuel is a knight\") would also be false, which again contradicts the fact that it's stated as true. Therefore, this scenario is also not possible.\n\nSince both scenarios lead to contradictions, Daniel cannot be a knight.\n\n#### Case 2: Assume Daniel is a knave.\n- If Daniel is a knave, then his statement must be false.\n- Daniel says: \"Samuel is a knave or Samuel is a knight.\"\n  - This means that one of these conditions must be true but the other must be false.\n\nLet's consider the possible cases for Samuel:\n- If Samuel is a knave:\n  - The first part of Daniel's statement (\"Samuel is a knave\") is false because Samuel is indeed a knave.\n  - The second part of Daniel's statement (\"Samuel is a knight\") is also false because Samuel is not a knight.\n  - Both parts being false makes the whole statement true, which is consistent with Daniel lying.\n\n- If Samuel is a knight:\n  - The first part of Daniel's statement (\"Samuel is a knave\") is true because Samuel is indeed a knave.\n  - The second part of Daniel's statement (\"Samuel is a knight\") is false because Samuel is actually a knight.\n  - Here, both parts contradict each other, making the entire statement false.\n\nIn both sub-cases where Samuel could either be a knave or a",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsubject\nLet's analyze the comments made by Sophia and Charlotte to determine who is a knight and who is a knave.\n\n1. **Sophia's Comments:**\n   - Comment 1: \"If Sophia is a knight then Charlotte is a knave.\"\n     - If Sophia is a knight (always tells the truth), then the statement \"Charlotte is a knave\" must be true. Therefore, Charlotte is indeed a knave.\n   - Comment 2: \"Sophia is a knave and Sophia is a knight\"\n     - This comment is contradictory because it states both that Sophia is a knight and a knave simultaneously. Hence, this cannot be true for either Sophia or Charlotte.\n\n2. **Charlotte's Comments:**\n   - Comment 1: \"Sophia is a knight and Charlotte is a knave.\"\n     - If Sophia is a knight, then the first part of her statement (\"Sophia is a knight\") is true.\n     - If Sophia is a knave, then the second part of her statement (\"Charlotte is a knave\") would need to be false.\n   - Comment 2: \"Sophia is a knave and Sophia is a knight\"\n     - This comment is again contradictory like Sophia's initial comment, so neither can be true for either Sophia or Charlotte.\n\nFrom these observations:\n\n- Sophia cannot be a knight since her first statement contradicts her identity being a knight.\n- Sophia cannot be a knave because her second statement about herself also contradicts her status as a knave.\n  \nThus, we conclude:\n- Sophia is a knave.\n- Charlotte is a knight.\n\nFinal Result: Charlotte is a knight, Sophia is a knave.",

Therefore, if Charlotte is a knave, Evelyn must be a knave.\n\n2. **Evelyn's Note**: Evelyn is a knight if and only if Charlotte is a knight.\n   - This means Evelyn will say something consistent with either Charlotte being a knight or a knave.\n\nNow let's consider two scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1**: Assume Charlotte is a knight.\n- If Charlotte is a knight, then according to Charlotte's note, Evelyn must also be a knight.\n- However, this contradicts Evelyn's note because Evelyn claims she is a knight only if Charlotte is a knight. Since we assumed Charlotte is a knight, Evelyn cannot be a knight at this point.\n\nTherefore, Charlotte cannot be a knight.\n\n**Scenario 2**: Assume Charlotte is a knave.\n- If Charlotte is a knave, then according to Charlotte's note, Evelyn must be a knave.\n- However, this contradicts Evelyn's note because Evelyn says she is a knight only if Charlotte is a knight. Since we assumed Charlotte is a knave, Evelyn can't be a knight under these conditions.\n\nSince neither scenario holds true given the constraints of their statements, it seems there might be an inconsistency.

Therefore, Henry cannot be telling the truth.\n\n    - Now assume Henry is lying. Then at least one part of his statement must be false:\n        - If \"David is a knave\" is false, then David is not a knave.\n        - If \"David is a knight\" is false, then David is not a knight.\n    \n    - Since we already established that Henry is lying, let\u2019s focus on David\u2019s statement now:\n      - If \"Henry is a knave\" is true, it aligns with Henry being dishonest, so David will say \"Henry is a knave\", which matches what Henry said.\n      - If \"Henry is a knave\" is false, then Henry must actually be a knight. But for David to lie correctly as per Henry's statement, he would need to say \"Henry is a knave\", making him a liar and thus contradicting himself.\n\nGiven all possible scenarios leading nowhere logically consistent except when directly comparing their statements without assuming Henry's exact veracity, it becomes clear they can't both be correct under typical assumptions unless they're mutually contradictory.\n\nHowever, considering common logical deduction rules applied here:\n- Assuming Henry is a knight and David is a knave fits all provided clues well since:\n  - If Henry were a knight, he'd tell the truth.\n  - \"David is a knave and David is a knight\" would imply falsehood due to self contradiction.\n  \n- Thus,",

Avery says that Chloe is both a knight and a knave simultaneously. This statement cannot be true because a person can't be both a knight and a knave at the same time.\n\n2. Since Avery's statement about Chloe being both a knight and a knave is false (because it implies a contradiction), we need to consider two cases for Avery\u2019s statement:\n   - Case 1: Avery is a knight. If Avery is a knight, then his statement must be true, which means Chloe is both a knight and a knave. However, this contradicts the fact that one of them cannot be both a knight and a knave.\n   - Case 2: Avery is a knave. If Avery is a knave, then his statement must be false, which means Chloe is neither a knight nor a knave. This aligns with the fact that one of them can't be both a knight and a knave.\n\n3. Now, let's look at Chloe's statement: \"Avery is not a knight.\"\n\n4. If Avery were a knight, according to Chloe's statement, she would be lying, but this doesn\u2019t affect the consistency of her own statement since she knows Avery is indeed a knave. Therefore, if Avery were a knight, Chloe's statement that Avery is not a knight would be correct, making Chloe herself a knight.\n\n5.

Thus, Olivia cannot be a knight.\n- Conversely, if Olivia were a knave, her statement that Joseph is a knave would be true (because knaves always lie), which again contradicts Joseph saying she is a knight. Thus, Olivia cannot be a knave either.\n\nGiven these contradictions, neither Olivia nor Joseph can be a knight or a knave under normal circumstances where each person either tells the truth or lies consistently with their own identity type.\n\nTherefore, there seems to be an inconsistency in the given conditions leading to no valid conclusion without additional context or constraints regarding their behavior within those confines.\n\n**Final Result: No valid solution exists.**\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nRESULT: None\n```",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsubject\nLet's analyze the statements made by Avery and Liam step by step.\n\n1. **Avery's Statement**: \"Avery is a knight or Liam is a knight.\"\n   - This means either Avery is telling the truth (i.e., he is a knight) or Liam is telling the truth (i.e., he is a knight).\n\n2. **Liam's Statement**: \"Liam is a knight if and only if Avery is a knave.\"\n   - This means two things:\n     - If Avery is a knight (which makes his statement true), then Liam must also be a knight (since Liam lies).\n     - If Avery is a knave (which makes his statement false), then Liam must also be a knave (since Liam tells the truth).\n\nNow let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n**Case 1: Avery is a knight**\n- If Avery is a knight, then Liam must be a knight because of Liam's statement.\n- But this contradicts Avery being a knight since it would mean both Avery and Liam are knights, which doesn't satisfy Liam's statement that they are not both knights (because Liam says \"if and only if\").\n\nSo, Avery cannot be a knight.\n\n**Case 2: Avery is a knave**\n- If Avery is a knave, then Liam must be a knave because of Liam's statement.\n- Now we need to check Liam's statement under this assumption:\n  - If Avery is a knave, then Liam must be a knave for Liam's statement to hold true (since Liam lies).\n  - This satisfies both parts of Liam's statement: if Avery is a knave (which makes Liam's statement false), then Liam must also be a knave (since Liam tells the truth). And if Avery is a knave, Liam will indeed be a knave according to Liam's statement.\n\nThus, Liam must be a knave and Avery must be a knave as well.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSOLUTION: YES/NO,\nRESULT: Liam is a knave, Avery is a knave.",

Since Emma is indeed a knight, we accept this case.\n- If Isabella is a knight, her statement \\( \\text{Emma is a knave} \\implies \\text{Emma is a knight} \\) must also be true because Isabella is a knight (and therefore cannot lie). However, if Isabella were a knight, she would say that Emma is a knave, which contradicts our assumption that Emma is a knight. Therefore, this case does not hold.\n\n**Case 2: Assume both Emma and Isabella are knaves.**\n- If Emma is a knave, her statement \\( \\text{Isabella is a knight} \\implies \\text{Emma is a knight} \\) becomes false because it would imply that Emma is a knight when in fact she is a knave.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\n superintendent\nLet's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Isabella's Statement**: \"Emma is a knight or Emma is a knave.\"\n   - If Isabella is a knight, then Emma must indeed be either a knight or a knave (because knights always tell the truth).\n   - If Isabella is a knave, then Emma must be lying about being a knight or knave.\n\n2. **Emma's Statement**: \"Isabella is a knight or Emma is a knight.\"\n   - If Emma is a knight, then her statement would be true if Isabella were also a knight.\n   - If Emma is a knave, then her statement would be false because she is lying, which means neither Isabella nor Emma could both be knights (since knaves always lie).\n\nNow let's consider the two possibilities for each person:\n\n- **If Isabella is a knight**:\n  - Isabella's statement is true, so Emma must be either a knight or a knave.\n  - Emma's statement is also true since she is telling the truth about Isabella.\n  - Therefore, Emma must be a knight (if Isabella is a knight, Emma cannot be a knave, as that would contradict Isabella's statement).\n\nSo, we have:\n- Isabella is a knight.\n- Emma is a knight.\n\nIn conclusion:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\\\nRESULT: Isabella,knight, Emma,knight\n```",

Since Ava said in her second statement that she is a knight and David is a knight, if Ava was a knave, her first statement would be false, but since she said she is a knight, her first statement must be true. Thus, Ava cannot be a knave; she must be a knight.\n\n3. **Conclusion from Ava's statement**:\n   - Ava saying \"David is a knight and Ava is a knight\" confirms that both of these conditions are true.

Therefore, if he says \"if Logan is a knight then Ella is a knave\", it implies that Ella must indeed be a knave (false).\n   - If Logan is a knave (liar), then his statement must be false. Therefore, for him to say \"if Logan is a knight then Ella is a knave\", it means that either Logan is not a knight or Ella is not a knave. Since we already know from his being a liar that he cannot be a knight, the only logical conclusion is that Ella must be a knight.\n\n2. **Ella's Statement**: \"Ella is a knight and Logan is a knave.\"\n   - We have established that Logan is a knave. According to Ella's statement, she claims both parts of her sentence are true simultaneously. However, since Ella is a knave (lies), her statement itself contradicts itself because a knave can't make a true statement about herself.\n\nFrom the analysis above, we see a contradiction within Ella's statement due to her lying nature:\n\n- If Ella were a knight, her statement would be \"true\" which is impossible as a knight always tells the truth.\n- But since Ella is a knave, her statement must be false, meaning at least one part of her statement is false.\n\nSince Ella's statement involves both \"I am a knight\" and \"Logan is a knave\" and Ella is a knave, her first part (\"I am a knight\") must be false while her second part (\"Logan is a knave\") must also be false.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nLet's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Evelyn says, \"Olivia is a knight.\"**\n   - If Evelyn is a knight (truth-teller), then her statement must be true, so Olivia is indeed a knight.\n   - If Evelyn is a knave (liar), then her statement must be false, so Olivia cannot be a knight.\n\n2. **Olivia states, \"Either Evelyn is a knave or Olivia is a knight.\"**\n\n   Let's consider both cases for Evelyn:\n\n   **Case 1: Evelyn is a knight.**\n     - Since Evelyn is a knight, her statement that \"Olivia is a knight\" is true. This means Olivia is a knight.\n\n   **Case 2: Evelyn is a knave.**\n     - Since Evelyn is a knave, her statement that \"Olivia is a knight\" is false. This means Olivia cannot be a knight.\n\nFrom these analyses, we can conclude:\n- If Evelyn is a knight, then Olivia is also a knight.\n- If Evelyn is a knave, then Olivia cannot be a knight.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is that Evelyn is a knight and Olivia is a knight.\n\n**Final Result:** Yes/No\n\nThis solution satisfies all the conditions given in the problem.

This means that Evelyn being a knave does not imply that Liam is a knave; instead, it suggests that Liam could be either a knight or a knave.\n\n2. **Liam's Statement**: \"Liam is a knight or Evelyn is a knight.\"\n   - If Liam is a knight, then his statement must be true. This means that Liam is indeed a knight, which contradicts our assumption that Liam might also be a knave (as per Evelyn's statement). Therefore, Liam cannot be a knight.\n   - If Liam is a knave, then his statement must be false.

However, this directly contradicts Liam's statement \"Liam is a knight,\" which says he is a knight.\n  \n- **Case 2**: Assume Evelyn is a knave.\n  - Then, from Evelyn's statement, \"Evelyn is a knight\" must be false.

However, these cannot coexist because they contradict each other. Therefore, William cannot be a knight.\n\n#### Case 2: Assume William is a Knave\n\nIf William is a knave, his statement \"Penelope is a knave if and only if Penelope is a knight\" means that there are no consistent values for Penelope being either a knave or a knight since a knave cannot consistently claim that their opposite (being a knave if they are a knight) is false (since a knave lies).\n\nSince neither case allows for William to be either a knight or a knave without contradiction, it implies an inconsistency in our initial assumption about William's identity. \n\nHowever, considering the nature of knights and knaves, we need to ensure consistency in Penelope\u2019s statements as well.

This means that Harper is indeed a knave because an honest person would not say they are a knight when they are actually a knave.\n   - If Amelia is a knave, her statement must be false.

This means that James would have to be both a knave and a knight at the same time, which is impossible because an individual cannot be both a knave (who lies) and a knight (who tells the truth).\n   - Therefore, if Logan is lying, his statement must be false. Consequently, either James is not a knave, meaning he could be a knight, or James is not a knight, meaning he could be a knave.\n\n2. **James' statement:** \"Logan is a knave or Logan is a knight.\"\n   - Since we know from Logan's statement that it must be false, we can deduce that the statement \"Logan is a knave or Logan is a knight\" is also false. This means neither part of the disjunction can be true for Logan.\n\nGiven these deductions:\n\n- If James is a knight, then Logan must be a knave. However, if Logan is a knave, his statement \"James is a knave and James is a knight\" is false, but we've already established that James cannot be both a knight and a knave under any circumstances. Thus, this scenario leads to a contradiction.\n  \n- If James is a knave, then Logan must be a knight. In this case, Logan\u2019s statement \"James is a knave and James is a knight\" is true, as James indeed is both a knave and a knight.

This implies that Owen cannot be a knight when Luke is a knave.\n- Given that Owen cannot be a knight when Luke is a knave, and considering Owen's statement \"Owen is a knight or Luke is a knave,\" if Owen is indeed a knight (which contradicts our earlier conclusion), we need to reassess under the condition where Luke is a knave.\n\nSince Luke is a knave, his statement becomes irrelevant because knaves always lie.

Therefore, Liam cannot be a knight (because if he were, Avery would be lying about him being a knight). Hence, Liam must be a knave.\n    - **Case 2**: Assume Avery is a knave.\n      - Since Avery is a knave, his statement \"Liam is not a knight\" is false.

But we already concluded that Scarlett is a knight based on her first statement.\n   - If Scarlett is lying about herself being a knight, then her statement would be false because it says she is either a knave or a knight.\n     - In this case, since Scarlett is a liar, her statement can't be both true and false at the same time under any condition (as it doesn't make sense logically).

Since we know Owen cannot be a knave (otherwise Aria wouldn't have said \"if and only if\"), Aria's statement doesn\u2019t necessarily contradict anything directly about Owen's identity.

However, since Elizabeth cannot be a knave (as she would contradict herself if she were a liar), it follows that Aria must indeed be a knight.\n\n2. **Aria's Statement**: Aria said, \"Elizabeth is not a knave.\"\n   - Since we have already established that Aria is a knight, her statement must be true. Therefore, Elizabeth must not be a knave, meaning Elizabeth is either a knight or a knave but not both.\n\nSince Elizabeth cannot be a knave (because if she were, her statement about Aria being a knave would be false), she must be a knight.

If Olivia is a knave (which she claims to be true), then Ethan must also be a knave (which he claims to be false).\n       2. If Olivia is a knight (which she claims to be true), then Ethan must also be a knight (which he claims to be false).\n\n2. **Assessing Possible Truths for Ethan and Olivia**:\n   - Since knights always tell the truth and knaves always lie, we need to consider both possibilities (both are knights or one is a knight while the other is a knave) for each statement.\n\n3. **Possible Scenarios**:\n   - Let's assume there are three possible scenarios based on the above analysis:\n\n     **Scenario A**: Both Ethan and Olivia are knaves.\n        - Ethan says \"Knave\" which is a lie, so he is actually telling the truth about Olivia being a knave.\n        - Olivia says \"Knight\" which is a lie, so she is actually telling the truth about herself being a knight.\n         - This scenario leads to an inconsistency because if both are knaves, they cannot simultaneously say they are either knights or knaves.\n\n     **Scenario B**: One of them is a knight, and the other is a knave.\n        - Assume Ethan is a knight and Olivia is a knave:\n          - Ethan would be telling the truth when he says \"Olivia is a knave,\" but since he is a knight, his claim must be true.\n          - Therefore, Olivia saying \"Olivia is a knave\" would be lying, making her a knave.\n            - In this case, Ethan is a knight and Olivia is a knave, satisfying all conditions without contradiction.\n\n8. **Conclusion**:\n    - The first condition states that Ethan tells the truth when Olivia is a knave, implying Ethan is a knight.\n    - The second condition states that Olivia lies when she says Olivia is a knave, confirming that Olivia is indeed a knave.\n\nTherefore, Ethan is a knight, and Olivia is a knave.\n\n**Final Result:**\n```\nYES, KNIGHT,KNAVE\n```",

However, for Zoey to be telling the truth, she cannot be a knave, so this case doesn't make sense because it would imply that Zoey isn\u2019t lying about being a knave.\n     - If Zoey is a knave (which means she lies), then her statement must be false because if a knave says something is true when it\u2019s actually false, he is indeed lying. In this case, since she is a liar, the implication holds, meaning that Zoey is both a knave and a knight simultaneously, which contradicts the definition of a knave.\n\nGiven these contradictions, let's consider the other possibility:\n\n2. **Analyzing Zoey's statement**: \"Isabella is a knave and Zoey is a knight.\"\n   - This statement directly implies two things: Isabella is a knave and Zoey is a knight. Both parts of the statement must be true, as they do not contradict each other and are consistent with the nature of knights and knaves.\n\nFrom this analysis, we conclude:\n- Zoey is a knight because she is claiming that Isabella is a knave and herself is a knight.\n- Isabella is a knave because she is claiming that Zoey is a knave but Zoey claims that Isabella is a knave and herself is a knight, leading to a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO/NY\nRESULT: zoey,knight,isabella,knave\n```",

Therefore, if Sophia were indeed a knave, she would have told the truth about Scarlett being a knight, but this conflicts with the fact that knights always tell the truth and knaves always lie.\n   - Thus, Scarlett cannot be a knight.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\n superintendent\nLet's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Chloe**: \"Ethan is a knight or Ethan is a knave.\"\n   - This statement can be broken down into two possibilities:\n     a) If Ethan is a knight, then Ethan tells the truth, so \"Ethan is a knight\" must be true.\n     b) If Ethan is a knave, then Ethan lies, so \"Ethan is a knight\" must be false.\n\n2. **Ethan**: \"Chloe is a knave and Ethan is a knight.\"\n\n3. Let's consider both cases from Chloe's statement:\n\n### Case 1: Assume Ethan is a knight (truth-teller):\n- If Ethan is a knight, his statement \"Chloe is a knave and Ethan is a knight\" would be true because he is telling the truth. However, we already know Ethan is a knight, which contradicts our assumption since he cannot be a knave if he is a knight. Therefore, this case leads to a contradiction.\n\n### Case 2: Assume Ethan is a knave (liar):\n- If Ethan is a liar, his statement \"Chloe is a knave and Ethan is a knight\" would be false because he is lying. Since Ethan is a liar, the condition for him being a knight must be false. Thus, \"Chloe is a knave\" must be false, meaning Chloe could either be a knight or a knave. But we also need to check if \"Ethan is a knight\" is false. Since Ethan is a liar, he does not have to be a knight, so this doesn't contradict Ethan being a liar.\n\nNow let's examine what happens when we assume Ethan is a knight:\n\nIf Ethan were a knight, his statement \"Chloe is a knave and Ethan is a knight\" would be true. However, we've established that Ethan cannot be a knight under any circumstances because of our earlier contradiction. \n\nSo, the only consistent scenario is that Ethan is a liar. Now let's see how this affects Chloe:\n\nSince Ethan is a liar, his statement \"Chloe is a knave and Ethan is a knight\" is false. Given that Ethan is a liar, the part about \"Ethan is a knight\" is false, confirming that \"Chloe is a knave\" must be true as well. Thus, Chloe is a knave.\n\nTherefore, Ethan is a liar, and Chloe is a knave.\n\n**FINAL RESULT:** Chloe is",

Since \\(L\\) is already \\(T\\), it follows that \\(E'\\) must also be \\(F\\).

But since \\(L = F\\), there is no contradiction here. However, Emily's statement tells us that she is a knave if and only if Logan is a knight, but if Logan is a knave, then Emily cannot be a knave. This creates a contradiction unless we reconsider the possibility of her statement being false when Logan is a knave.\n\nSince both Logan and Emily contradict each other under their respective conditions, the only consistent solution is for them to alternate roles such that one is telling the truth and the other is lying. \n\nGiven this analysis, we conclude:\n- **Logan** is a knave.\n- **Emily** is a knight.\n\nTherefore, the final result is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\\\nRESULT: Logie is a knave, Zoey is a knight.\n```",

Therefore, this part does not affect the overall truth value of the statement.\n\n2. **Samuel's Statement**: \"Liam is a knight if and only if Liam is a knave.\"\n   - This can also be broken down into two cases again.\n     - Case 1 (Liam is a knight): If Liam is a knight, then \"Liam is a knight if and only if Liam is a knave\" is true.\n     - Case 2 (Liam is a knave): If Liam is a knave, then \"Liam is a knave if and only if Liam is a knight\" would mean that being a knave implies being a knight, which is logically impossible. Hence, this case cannot be valid.\n\nNow let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Case 1**: Assume Liam is a knight.\n  - According to Liam's statement, if Samuel is a knave, then Samuel must be a knight.

If Abigail were a knave, Scarlett's statement would be false, leading to an inconsistency.\n\n3. **Evelyn's Statement**: \"Scarlett is not a knight.\"\n   - If Evelyn is a knight, then she would be telling the truth, meaning Scarlett is indeed not a knight.\n   - If Evelyn is a knave, then she would be lying, so Scarlett must actually be a knight, which contradicts the previous analysis.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- Since Scarlett claims that Abigail is a knight and Abigail cannot be both a knight and a knave at the same time based on our first observation, it follows logically that Abigail is a knight.\n- Now knowing Abigail is a knight, her statement \"Abigail is a knight if and only if Evelyn is a knight\" becomes true because the condition is met (both are knights).\n- Since Abigail is a knight, her statement holds true for all individuals mentioned, including herself, Scarlett, and Evelyn.\n- Therefore, Scarlett is also a knight as she confirms Abigail is a knight.\n- Finally, Evelyn being a knight means her statement that Scarlett is not a knight is incorrect, but it doesn't affect the identity of the others.\n\nThus, the identities are:\n- Abigail is a knight,\n- Scarlett is a knight,\n- Evelyn is a knight.\n\n**FINAL RESULT:**\n```\nYES/NO,\nresult: knight,knight,knight\n```",

Therefore, this statement can't be logically consistent if we assume any single person to be a knight.\n\n**Statement 3 (Victoria):**\n- Victoria states that if Matthew is a knight, then Matthew is a knave.\n  - Since Victoria is a knave, her statement must be false regardless of whether Matthew is a knight or a knave. Thus, the implication \\( \\text{if } M = K \\Rightarrow M = N \\) where \\( M \\) represents Matthew, \\( K \\) represents Knight, and \\( N \\) represents Knave, leads us to conclude that the relationship between Matthew and his status as a knight is irrelevant since she lies about it.\n\nGiven the analysis above, here\u2019s what we infer from these statements:\n\n- Penelope and Matthew cannot both claim they are knights together because their statements contradict each other.\n  \nFrom Statement 2, if Victoria's first part (\"Victoria is a knave\") is true, then her second part (\"Victoria is a knight\") cannot be true. However, if Victoria's second part is true, then her first part is false, leading to an inconsistency.\n\nFor Statement 3, Victoria lying implies no specific logical implications based on Matthew's identity directly affect her assertion.\n\nSince there seems to be an inherent contradiction when considering Penelope and Matthew's dual affirmations regarding each other's identities, it suggests at least one of them might be deceptive.\n\nHowever, due to the nature of contradictions within their statements, especially given Victoria's contradictory claims about herself, it appears none of them can definitively confirm each other's statuses without further context not provided in this information alone.\n\nThus",

This means Abigail is indeed a knight.\n- If **James** is a knight, according to Abigail's claim, since she is a knight, her statement \"If James is a knight, then Abigail is a knight\" must also be true. However, we already established that if James were a knight, Abigail would have to be a knight too, which contradicts our assumption that Abigail could be a liar as well (since knaves always lie).\n\nSo, let's consider two scenarios:\n\n#### Scenario 1: Assume **James** is a knight.\n- Then **Abigail**'s claim implies that **Abigail** is a knight because her statement is true when James is a knight.\n- But if **Abigail** is a knight, her original statement \"If James is a knight, then Abigail is a knight\" would be false, creating a contradiction.\n\n#### Scenario 2: Assume **James** is a knave.\n- Since **James** is a knave, his statement \"Abigail is a knight\" is a lie. Therefore, Abigail cannot be a knight.\n- Now, **Abigail's claim**: \"If James is a knight, then Abigail is a knight.\" Since James is a knave, the condition \"James is a knight\" is false, making the entire claim vacuously true regardless of what Abigail says.\n\nSince Abigail can't be a knight based on James being a knave, it leaves us with **Ava**, who made the statement about Abigail.\n\n### Conclusion\n- **James** is a knave because his statement conflicts with himself assuming he is a knight.\n- **Abigail** is a knave for similar reasons.\n- **Ava** is a knight because her statement about Abigail being not a knight holds true under these assumptions.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO/NODETECT\nRESULT: Ava,knight\n```",

Therefore, his statement becomes \"Aria is a knave,\" which is true.\n   - If Victoria is a knave (N), then her statement is false if she says \"Aria is a knave.\" This implies Aria cannot be a knave, making Aria a knight (K).

In that case, Emily's statement about Abigail being a knight is correct but does not affect the fact that Abigail is indeed a knave according to Harper's own statement.\n\n**Conclusion:** \n- Harper is a knave.\n- Abigail is a knave.\n- Emily is a knight.\n\nSo, the final result is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\\ \nRESULT: knave,knight,knight\n```",

This means Sophia is indeed a knight.\n\nNow we know:\n- Logan is a knight.\n- Sophia is a knight.\n\nNext, let's check Lucas's statement under this assumption.\n- Lucas says: \"If Sophia is a knave then Logan is a knight.\"\n- Since Sophia is now confirmed as a knight, which contradicts the condition of the statement because it would imply Logan is not a knight (which he actually is). Therefore, Lucas cannot be a knight.\n\nThis leads us to a contradiction since Lucas cannot be both a knight and a knave simultaneously based on his own statement. Hence, Logan cannot be a knight.\n\n#### Case 2: Suppose Logan is a knave.\n- If Logan is a knave, his statement \"Sophia is a knight\" must be false.

However, if Scarlett says she is a knight (her statement), it contradicts herself since she cannot both say she is a knight and be lying about Charlotte being a knave. This leads to a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, Elizabeth cannot be a knight.\n\n#### Case 2: Assume Elizabeth is a Knave\nIf Elizabeth is a knave, then her statement must be false.

If David were a knight, his statement would logically follow because knights always tell the truth. However, since we don't know David's status yet, let's consider it as an open possibility for now.\n   \n2. **Mason** directly states that he believes David is a knight. This means that if David is a knight, Mason will agree; otherwise, he might be lying about believing David is a knight. \n\n3. **Harper** makes a conditional statement: \"David is a knight or Harper is a knight.\" Since Harper is stating this, she could either be telling the truth or lying based on her own identity. \n\n#### Evaluating Possibilities:\nSince Harper's statement implies that if she is a knight, then David must be a knight. Therefore, if Harper is a knight, then David must indeed be a knight. Conversely, if Harper is a liar, she would have to claim that David is not a knight but still say that if David is a knight, then Mason is a knight, which seems inconsistent unless Harper herself is a liar.\n\nThus, if Harper is a knight, both conditions of David being a knight and Mason being a knight are satisfied. This leaves us with two scenarios to explore further:\n\n1. **Case 1**: Harper is a knight.\n   - If Harper is a knight, then David must be a knight (since Harper\u2019s statement is true).\n   - Then, according to David\u2019s statement, if David is a knight, Mason must also be a knight (because knights always tell the truth).\n\n    In this case:\n   - David is a knight.\n   - Mason is a knight.\n   - Harper is a knight.\n\n2. **Case 2**: Harper is a liar.\n   - If Harper is a liar, then her statement \u201cDavid is a knight or Harper is a knight\u201d is false.\n     - This means both parts of the statement must be false simultaneously:\n       - David cannot be a knight (since Harper is a liar and her statement implies this).\n      ",

But this would contradict our initial assumption because Samuel cannot be both a knight and a liar at the same time based on his own statement.\n\n- **Therefore, assume Penelope is a knave (P = F)**:\n  - Now we know Penelope is not a knight, so P \u2260 T.\n  - From Penelope's statement, \"If Penelope is a knight then Riley is a knight,\" it must be false. Therefore, Riley cannot be a knight either.\n  - From Samuel's statement, since Penelope is a knave, Samuel must also be a knave (S = F) because he lies about what Penelope says.\n\nThus, Penelope is a knave, Riley is a knave, and Samuel is a knight.\n\n**Final Result**: Riley is a knave, Samuel is a knight, and Penelope is a knave.",

Jackson's statement: \"Samuel is not a knave.\"\n\nFirst, let's consider Abigail's statement. If Jackson were a knight (truth-teller), then his statement would be true because he would say \"Samuel is not a knave,\" which matches his own statement. However, if Jackson were a knave (liar), his statement would be false because he would say \"Samuel is not a knave,\" but that means Samuel could potentially be a knave.\n\nNow, let's check Samuel's statement under both scenarios for Jackson:\n\n- **If Jackson is a knight:** Then Samuel's statement \"Jackson is a knight or Jackson is a knave\" is true. Since Jackson is a knight, we need to determine what Samuel says next.\n  \n    - Abigail's statement becomes \"Samuel is a knight if and only if Samuel is a knave.\"\n      - This statement implies that Samuel must be both a knight and a knave, which contradicts itself since no one can be both a knight and a knave at the same time. Therefore, Jackson cannot be a knight.\n      \n    - Jackson's statement becomes \"Samuel is not a knave.\"\n      - Since Jackson is a knight, his statement is true, so Samuel is indeed not a knave.\n\n- **If Jackson is a knave:** Then Samuel's statement \"Jackson is a knight or Jackson is a knave\" is false. We already know Jackson is a knave from previous analysis. \n\n    - Abigail's statement remains consistent as before.\n    \n    - Jackson's statement becomes \"Samuel is not a knave.\"\n      - Since Jackson is a knave, his statement is false, meaning Samuel is actually a knave.\n\nFrom these analyses, we have determined that Jackson is a knave, Samuel is a knave, and Abigail is a knight.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO,NOK\nRESULT: Michael is a knave, Zoey is a knave, Ethan is a knave\n```",

Therefore, she would say \"Oliver is a knight or Alexander is a knave.\" Since we know Oliver is not a knave (otherwise Alexander would also have to be a knave), it follows that Sophie cannot be a knight because if she were, her statement would imply that either Oliver is a knight or Alexander is a knave, but we already established that Oliver is not a knave.\n   - Hence, Sophie must be a knave. This means her statement is false, implying that both conditions for her statement being true are not met. Specifically, \"Oliver is a knight or Alexander is a knave\" is false since Oliver is not a knave.\n\nSince Sophie cannot be a knight based on our analysis so far, let\u2019s reconsider the other possibilities:\n\n#### Statement 2: \"Oliver is a knight or Alexander is a knave.\"\n   - If Oliver is a knight, then his statement must be true. Therefore, he says \"Sophia is a knight and Alexander is a knave,\" which contradicts our earlier conclusion that Sophie is a knave. Thus, Oliver cannot be a knight.\n   - Therefore, Oliver must be a knave.

Hence, Aiden must also be a knave.\n\n3. **Aiden** said, \"If Logan is a knight then Olivia is a knave.\"\n   - We have determined that Logan is a knight from Logan's first statement.\n   - However, based on our analysis of Aiden's statement, if Logan is a knight, then Olivia is a knight according to Aiden's second part, which contradicts the previous findings.\n\nThis contradiction indicates an inconsistency in the problem setup or interpretation. Let's re-evaluate the logical flow carefully:\n\n- Olivia states: \"If Olivia is a knight then Logan is a knight.\" Since Olivia is indeed a knight, her statement holds true.\n- Logan claims: \"Olivia is a knave if and only if Aiden is a knight.\" Given Olivia is a knight, her truthfulness aligns perfectly with Logan's claim.\n- Aiden says: \"If Logan is a knight then Olivia is a knave.\" Here, Aiden directly contradicts his own claim when considering that if Logan is a knight (which he is), Olivia should not be a knave but rather a knight as established earlier.\n\nGiven these contradictions, there seems to be a fundamental error in the problem's conditions. The provided statements lead to an impossible scenario where each person's statement about others' identities creates a paradox.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is that **there is no valid solution under these assumptions**, indicating that the problem may need revision or additional context.\n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nRESULT: No information\n```",

Therefore, Emily cannot be both a knave and a knight at the same time.\n\n2. **Mia's Statement**: \"William is a knave.\"\n   - If William were a knight, he would be telling the truth when he says \"If Emily is a knave then Emily is a knight,\" which implies that Emily is indeed a knight.

This means that \"Lily is a knave if and only if Sofia is a knave\" is true. This implies two cases:\n  - If Lily is a knave, then Sofia must also be a knave (since they are both being called knaves).\n  - If Sofia is a knave, then Lily must also be a knave (since they are both being called knaves).\n\nIn either case, Lily and Sofia would have to be knaves. But we cannot have both Lily and Sofia as knaves because there can't be more than one knave on the island. Therefore, Alexander cannot be a knight; he must be a knave.\n\n### Step 2: Substitute Alexander's Status into Sofia's Statement\nSince Alexander is a knave, his statement \"Alexander is a knave or Lily is a knight\" becomes false. This means that Alexander is not a knave and Lily is not a knight. However, since Alexander is a knave, his statement about Lily being a knave must be a lie. Thus, Lily must actually be a knight.\n\n### Step 3: Substitute Lily's Status into Sofia's Statement\nNow, we know that Lily is a knight. Her statement \"Alexander is a knight or Sofia is a knight\" must be true. Since Alexander is known to be a knave, it follows that Sofia must be a knight.\n\n### Conclusion\nSo, the final status of the inhabitants is:\n- Alexander is a knave,\n- Sofia is a knight,\n- Lily is a knight.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO, YES, YES\nRESULT: Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, Ethan is a knave.\n```",

But since Evelyn's statement is true (Ava is not a knight), Evelyn must be a knave (\\( E = K' \\)).\n\nSo far, we know:\n- \\( A = K \\)\n- \\( E = K' \\)\n\n3. **Amelia's Statement**: \"Ava is a knave and Evelyn is a knave.\"\n   - Since we already established that \\( A = K \\) and \\( E = K' \\), Amelia's statement cannot be true because both Ava and Evelyn are knaves.\n\nSince Amelia's statement is false, it tells us something about the other two individuals:\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - If Amelia's statement was true, then both Ava and Evelyn being knaves would make Amelia's statement correct. However, we found out that Ava is indeed a knight (\\( A = K \\)), which makes Amelia's statement false.\n   - Therefore, Amelia must be telling the truth when she says that Ava is a knave and Evelyn is a knave.\n\nThus, based on the information given:\n- Ava is a knight (\\( A = K \\)).\n- Evelyn is a knave (\\( E = K' \\)).\n- Amelia is a knave (\\( A = K' \\)).\n\n**Final Result:** Ava is a knight, Evelyn is a knave, and Amelia is a knave.",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsubject\nLet's analyze each statement step-by-step to determine who is a knight and who is a knave.\n\n1. **Avery's Statement**: \"Avery is a knight if and only if Henry is a knight.\"\n   - If Avery is a knight (truth-teller), then Avery must say the truth about himself being a knight or not. This means Henry cannot be a knight because Avery would be lying otherwise.\n   - If Avery is a knave (liar), then Avery is lying about his own status as a knight, which means Avery could either be a knight or a knave. However, since Avery claims he is a knight, we need to consider two cases:\n     - Case 1: Avery is a knight. Then Avery says it\u2019s true that he is a knight, which makes his claim consistent.\n     - Case 2: Avery is a knave. In this case, Avery lies, so Avery is actually a knave.\n\n2. **Luke's Statement**: \"Henry is a knave.\"\n   - Since Luke is a knave, Luke is lying about Henry being a knave. Therefore, Henry cannot be a knave.\n\nFrom the above analysis:\n\n- **Henry** must be a knight (since he claimed something false).\n  \nNow let's look at Avery's situation given that Henry is a knight:\n- Avery states that \"Avery is a knight if and only if Henry is a knight\" is true. Given that Henry is a knight, Avery must be telling the truth about himself.\n- Thus, Avery must be a knight.\n\nFinally, considering Luke's statement again:\n- Luke claimed that \"If Luke is a knave then Avery is a knave\" is true. Since Luke is a knave, this statement is also false. Therefore, Avery must be a knight (as stated earlier).\n\nSo, Avery is a knight, and Luke is a knave.

However, this creates a contradiction because we already determined from Emma\u2019s statement that Victoria must not be a knight. Therefore, Scarlett cannot be a knight.\n\n3. **Victoria's Statement**: \"Scarlett is not a knight.\"\n   - Since Scarlett is a liar (knight), her statement is false. Thus, it contradicts itself and does not provide useful information about whether Scarlett is a knight or a knave. We need to focus on Emma and Victoria since their statements directly affect each other.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n    - From Emma's statement, we know that if she were truthful, Victoria would have to be a knave. But since Emma is a knight, Victoria can't be a knight.\n    - Scarlett is a liar, so her statement that Emma is a knave and Scarlett is a knight is false, which means Emma cannot be a knave and Scarlett cannot be a knight simultaneously.\n\nGiven these points, let's re-evaluate:\n- Emma being a knight means her statement (\"Victoria is not a knight\") is true, implying Victoria is a knave.\n- Scarlett being a liar means her statement (\"Emma is a knave and Scarlett is a knight\") is false.

This means either Mia is a knave (Q) or Mia is a knight (K). However, if Mia is a knave (Q), then Mia cannot say that she is a knight because knaves always lie. Therefore, Mia must be a knight (K). But then Mia says that she is a knight, which contradicts our assumption that Sophia is a knight. Thus, Sophia cannot be a knight.\n\n### Scenario 2: Suppose Sophia is a Knave (Q).\n- If Sophia is a knave (Q), then her statement must be false. This means both parts of the statement \"Mia is a knave or Mia is a knight\" are false. So, Mia must not be a knave (not Q) and also not a knight (not K). This implies Mia must be a knave (Q). Now we need to check Mia's statement: \"Mia is a knight or Sophia is a knight.\"\n   - Since Mia is a knave (Q), her statement \"Mia is a knight or Sophia is a knight\" would be false. This means it is impossible for Mia's statement to be true given our current scenario where Mia is a knave. Therefore, this scenario is inconsistent.\n\nSince neither Sophia nor Mia can consistently fit as a knight based on their statements under any consistent assignment of roles (Knight or Knave), there seems to be an inconsistency in our initial assumptions about the identities of Sophia, Mia, and Emily.\n\nHowever, upon re-evaluating the problem carefully, it appears there might have been a misinterpretation in the logical structure of the statements. Let's reconsider:\n\n### Re-evaluation:\n- If Sophia's statement were interpreted more strictly, it could mean two separate cases: either Mia is a knave or Mia is a knight.\n- Mia's statement interprets the situation similarly but focuses on herself instead of others.\n- Emily",

However, Jackson cannot be both a knight and a knave simultaneously, so this leads to a contradiction.\n- If Jacob is a knave, then Jackson must be a knave (from Jacob's statement). Now check Elizabeth's statement. Since Jackson is a knave, it does not contradict anything here, but neither does Elizabeth stating she is a knight because Jackson is a knave.\n- If Jackson is a knight, then Elizabeth must be a knave (since Jackson cannot be both a knight and a knave, and Elizabeth's statement implies she is a knave). Finally, check Jacob's statement. Since Jackson is a knight, his statement that if Jacob is a knight then Jackson is a knight is true (though irrelevant here), and Jacob himself is a knight.\n\nGiven these analyses, we find that Jackson is the only consistent inhabitant who fits the conditions provided. \n\nSo, the final result is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Jackson\n```",

Therefore, Luke being a knight contradicts his own statement.\n   - If Luke is a knave, then his statement must be false. This means Emily is not a knight and not a knave. Since there can only be one type of inhabitant, this implies that all three of them are knaves.\n\n3. **Jack says**: \"Luke is not a knave.\"\n   - If Jack is a knight, then his statement must be true. This means Luke is not a knave, which aligns with our conclusion from Luke's previous statement.\n   - If Jack is a knave, then his statement must be false. This means Luke is a knave, but we already concluded that Luke is a knave, so this doesn't provide new information.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n\n- Emily cannot be a knight because her statement leads to contradictions.\n- Luke cannot be a knight because his statement about Emily being a knight leads to a contradiction.\n- Jack must therefore be a knight because his statement about Luke being not a knave is true.\n\nSo, the final result is:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO/YES,\nRESULT: Jack,knave,Emily,knave,Luke,knave\n```",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nsystem\nTo solve this problem, let's analyze each statement one by one:\n\n1. **James's Statement**: \"Owen is a knight if and only if Logan is a knave.\"\n   - This means that for James to say this, both conditions must hold simultaneously: either Owen is a knight (true) and Logan is a knave (false), or Owen is a knave (false) and Logan is a knight (true).\n\n2. **Owen's Statement**: \"James is a knave if and only if Owen is a knight.\"\n   - This also requires two conditions to be true simultaneously: either James is a knave (true) and Owen is a knight (false), or James is a knight (false) and Owen is a knave (true).\n\n3. **Logan's Statement**: \"Owen is a knight or Owen is a knave.\"\n   - This simplifies to \"Owen is not a knave\" since \"or\" translates to an exclusive disjunction.\n\nLet's break down the implications:\n\n- From James's first condition: If James says this, then James must be telling the truth about Owen being a knight and Logan being a knave, but since we don't know if James is a knight or a knave yet, this doesn't give us direct information about them.\n  \n- From James's second condition: Since we assume James could be either a knight or a knave based on his statements, this does not provide additional useful information unless we can determine which of these statements he makes truthful.\n\n- From Owen's statement: If Owen says this, then James would need to be lying about whether James is a knight or a knave. However, since James cannot consistently make contradictory statements without inconsistency, we conclude that James must be consistent across his statements. Therefore, James must be a knight because his statements do not contradict each other logically.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications for Owen and Logan given that James is a knight:\n\n- If James is a knight, then his statements must be true. His first statement (\"Owen is a knight if and only if Logan is a knave\") implies that neither Owen nor Logan can both be knights or both be knaves simultaneously.\n\n- If James is a knight, then his second statement (\"James is a knave if and only if Owen is a knight\") also aligns with James being a knight because if James were a knave, his statements would have contradictions.\n\n- Logen's statement (\"Owen is a",

This means either Oliver is a knave or Ethan is a knight.\n     - Case 1: Oliver is a knave.\n       - If Oliver is a knave, both conditions for Daniel being a knight are met because \"Oliver is a knave\" is true, and \"Ethan is a knight\" is false.\n     - Case 2: Ethan is a knight.\n       - If Ethan is a knight, then his statement is false, but it doesn't affect the overall truth of Daniel's statement because it's an OR condition. Therefore, Daniel can still be considered as a knight.\n   \n   - If Daniel is a knave, his statement must be false, meaning neither \"Oliver is a knave\" nor \"Ethan is a knight\" is true.\n     - This implies that both Oliver and Ethan are knights, but since we already concluded they might be different based on Ethan's truthful assertion about himself, this scenario isn't consistent with our earlier findings unless there was an error in interpretation.\n\nFrom these analyses, let's re-evaluate the consistency:\n\n- If Ethan is a knight, then Daniel's statement logically holds true as stated above.\n- If Ethan is a knave, then Daniel's statement must be false, making Oliver a knave and Ethan a knight again.\n\nThus, we have two consistent scenarios:\n- Scenario A: Ethan is a knight, Daniel is a knight, Oliver is a knave.\n- Scenario B: Ethan is a knave, Daniel is a knight, Oliver is a knight.\n\nSince we cannot definitively state one without additional context or clarification, we conclude that both scenarios are possible based on the given information.

This means William is a knave.\n\n#### Statement 2: \"Ava is a knave.\"\nFrom our previous analysis, we concluded that William is a knave. Now let's check if Ava could also be a knave based on her own statement.\n\n#### Statement 3: \"William is a knave or Ava is a knave.\"\nSince William is a knave, the phrase \"William is a knave\" is false. Therefore, the entire sentence \"William is a knave or Ava is a knave\" becomes a disjunction where at least one part is false, making it false.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nTo determine who is a knight and who is a knave among Jackson, Lily, and Sebastian, let's analyze their statements step by step.\n\n1. **Jackson's Statement:**\n   - \"Sebastian is a knight and Jackson is a knight.\"\n\n2. **Lily's Claim:**\n   - \"Jackson is a knave if and only if Jackson is a knight.\"\n\n3. **Sebastian's Observation:**\n   - \"Jackson is a knave.\"\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Case 1: Assume Jackson is a Knight (K)\n- If Jackson is a knight, then both parts of his statement must be true.\n- Part 1: \"Sebastian is a knight.\"\n- Part 2: \"Jackson is a knight.\"\nSince we assumed Jackson is a knight, these two parts contradict each other because if Jackson is a knight, he cannot also claim that he is a knave. Therefore, Jackson cannot be a knight.\n\n#### Case 2: Assume Jackson is a Knave (Kn)\n- If Jackson is a knave, then both parts of his statement must be false.\n- Part 1: \"Sebastian is a knight.\" This would be a contradiction since a knave lies about everything.\n- Part 2: \"Jackson is a knight.\" Since it's a falsehood, Jackson can indeed be a knave without any contradictions.\n\nSo far, we have established that Jackson is not a knight (because it leads to a logical inconsistency). \n\nNow let's look at Lily's claim and Sebastian's observation:\n\n#### Lily's Claim: \"Jackson is a knave if and only if Jackson is a knight.\"\n- This means that for Lily\u2019s claim to be true, Jackson being a knave must be equal to Jackson being a knight.\n- In other words, either Jackson is a knave or Jackson is a knight but not both. Since we've already determined Jackson cannot be a knight, it follows that Jackson must be a knave.\n\n#### Conclusion\n- From our analysis, we conclude that Jackson is a knave.\n- Lily's claim states that Jackson is a knave, which aligns with our conclusion from the previous analysis.\n- Sebastian confirmed that Jackson is a knave, thus confirming the consistency of the situation.\n\nTherefore, the final results are:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Jackson is a knave, Lily is a knave, and Sebastian is a knave.\n```",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsys\nLet's analyze the information given step-by-step:\n\n1. **Chloe's Statement:** \"Alexander is a knave and Alexander is a knight.\"\n   - This statement can be broken down into two parts:\n     - If Alexander is a knave, then the first part (Alexander is a knave) is true.\n     - If Alexander is a knight, then the second part (Alexander is a knight) must be false.\n\n2. **Alexander's Statement:** \"Alexander is a knight or Chloe is a knave.\"\n   - Since Alexander is either a knight or a knave, we need to consider both possibilities for his statement.\n\n3. **Ethan's Statement:** \"Chloe is a knave and Alexander is a knight.\"\n   - Similarly, Ethan is either a knight or a knave, so we need to consider both possibilities for his statement.\n\nNow let's evaluate each possibility:\n\n### Case 1: Assume Chloe is a knight\n- Chloe's statement would mean that Alexander is not a knave (i.e., Alexander is a knight).\n- However, if Alexander were a knight, Alexander\u2019s statement (\"Alexander is a knight or Chloe is a knave\") would imply that Chloe is indeed a knave, which contradicts our assumption that Chloe is a knight.\n\nTherefore, assuming Chloe is a knight leads to an inconsistency.\n\n### Case 2: Assume Chloe is a knave\n- Chloe's statement becomes false because it says Alexander is a knave but Alexander is actually a knight.\n- Now, Alexander's statement would also become false since he asserts something contradictory (Alexander is a knight or Chloe is a knave), as we have established that Chloe is a knave.\n\nThus, if Chloe is a knave, all three individuals' statements would be false, leading to an impossible scenario.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince assuming Chloe is a knight or a knave leads to contradictions, there seems to be no consistent solution based on these assumptions alone. Therefore, the correct interpretation of the problem requires re-evaluating the initial conditions or possibly acknowledging a missing piece of information necessary to form a valid conclusion about their roles.\n\nHowever, based strictly on the provided statements without additional context or clarification, we cannot definitively determine who is a knight and who is a knave.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nLet's analyze the statements made by each inhabitant step-by-step.\n\n1. **Charlotte**: She said, \"Charlotte is a knight and Logan is a knight.\"\n   - If Charlotte is a knight, then her statement must be true. This means both parts of her statement must be true individually.\n     - \"Charlotte is a knight\" implies she is telling the truth about herself.\n     - \"Logan is a knight\" also implies he is telling the truth about himself.\n   - However, since we don't know for sure that Charlotte is a knight, let's consider the possibility that she might not be a knight but still make such an assertion.\n   - Logically, if Charlotte is lying (i.e., she is a knave), her statement would be false because one part of it is false (\"Charlotte is a knight\"). Therefore, if Charlotte were a knave, her statement would contradict itself, making it impossible for her to maintain consistency unless her claim was actually true.\n\n2. **Logan**: He said, \"Charlotte is a knight or David is a knight.\"\n   - If Logan is a knight, his statement must be true. This means at least one of the following must be true:\n     - \"Charlotte is a knight\"\n     - \"David is a knight\"\n   - If Logan is a knave, his statement must be false. This means neither part of the statement can be true simultaneously. Thus:\n     - \"Charlotte is a knight\" cannot be true.\n     - \"David is a knight\" cannot be true either.\n   - Given the options, we need to determine which combination of logicians allows us to resolve the situation without contradiction.\n\n3. **David**: He said, \"Charlotte is a knight if and only if Logan is a knight.\"\n   - If David is a knight, his statement must be true. This means:\n     - \"If Charlotte is a knight, then Logan is a knight.\"\n     - And vice versa: \"If Logan is a knight, then Charlotte is a knight.\"\n   - Since we already established that Charlotte cannot be a knave based on her initial statement being true, we infer that:\n     - Charlotte must indeed be a knight.\n     - If Charlotte is a knight, then \"Logan is a knight\" follows from her original statement.\n   - Now, using David\u2019s statement:\n     - \"If Charlotte is a knight, then Logan is a knight.\"\n     - But we've deduced that Charlotte is a knight.\n     - Therefore",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nTo solve this problem, let's analyze the statements made by each inhabitant:\n\n1. **Chloe says:** \"Oliver is not a knave.\"\n2. **Oliver says:** \"Chloe is not a knave.\"\n3. **Jack says:** \"If Jack is a knight, then Oliver is a knight.\"\n\nWe need to determine whether each of them is a knight or a knave based on their statements.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Case 1: Assume Oliver is a knight\n- If Oliver is a knight, his statement would be true because he claims that Chloe is not a knave.\n  - This implies Chloe is telling the truth about Oliver being truthful (not a knave).\n  \n- Now, we check if Jack can also be a knight under this assumption:\n  - Jack's statement is: \"If Jack is a knight, then Oliver is a knight.\"\n  - Since Oliver is a knight (assumed), the condition \"if Jack is a knight\" must hold true for Jack to be a knight.\n  \n- However, there is no information given about Jack's identity directly, so we cannot definitively say Jack is either a knight or a knave just from Oliver\u2019s statement alone.\n\n#### Case 2: Assume Oliver is a knave\n- If Oliver is a knave, his statement would be false because he claims that Chloe is not a knave.\n  - This means Chloe is lying about Oliver being truthful (not a knave).\n  \n- Let's consider what happens when Chloe lies:\n  - If Chloe is lying, then she could either be a knave herself or a knight.\n    - If Chloe were a knave, then her statement (\"Oliver is not a knave\") would be true, which contradicts our initial assumption since Oliver is supposed to be a knave. Therefore, Chloe cannot be a knave.\n    - Thus, Chloe must be a knight.\n\n- Now, checking Jack:\n  - Jack's statement is: \"If Jack is a knight, then Oliver is a knight.\"\n  - Since Oliver is a knave (we assumed he was a knave earlier), the implication \"if Jack is a knight\" does not affect Jack's status as a knight or a knave, but it doesn\u2019t change anything significant here either.\n\nSince we have determined both Oliver and Chloe are knights, and Jack is not mentioned further in contradiction to these assumptions, Jack must also be a knight.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll three inhabitants are knights.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nLet's analyze the claims made by each inhabitant step by step:\n\n1. **Lucas' Claim**: \"Lucas is a knight or Aurora is a knight.\"\n   - If Lucas is a knight, he would tell the truth, so \"Lucas is a knight\" must be true, which means \"Aurora is a knight\" must also be true (because if one part of \"or\" is true, the other part cannot be false).\n   - If Lucas is a knave, he would lie, so \"Lucas is a knight\" must be false, which implies that \"Aurora is a knight\" must also be false.\n\n2. **Luke's Claim**: \"Aurora is a knight and Lucas is a knight.\"\n   - If Luke is a knight, he would tell the truth, so both parts of his statement must be true.\n     - \"Aurora is a knight\"\n     - \"Lucas is a knight\"\n   - If Luke is a knave, he would lie, so at least one part of his statement must be false.\n     - Either \"Aurora is a knight\" is false, or \"Lucas is a knight\" is false.\n\n3. **Aurora's Claim**: \"If Lucas is a knave then Luke is a knave.\"\n   - If Lucas is a knight, \"if a knave then a knave\" is always true because a knave lies and says something that is false.\n   - If Lucas is a knave, \"if a knave then a knave\" is false because a knave lies and says something that is true.\n     - Therefore, either \"Lucas is a knave\" is true or \"Lucas is a knight\" is false.\n\nNow let's combine these insights to find consistent solutions:\n\n- From Lucas' claim, if Lucas is a knight, then Aurora is a knight. But from Luke's claim, if Lucas is a knave, then Luke is a knave. This creates a contradiction unless we consider the possibility that Lucas could be a liar. In this case, if Lucas is a knave, then Aurora must be a knave as well (to satisfy Luke's statement). However, this would mean Luke's statement (\"Aurora is a knight\") is false, but it contradicts Lucas being a knave.\n  \nThus, we can conclude:\n- Lucas is a knave.\n- Aurora is a knave.\n- Given Lucas is",

Again, this creates a contradiction because if Matthew is a knight, then Sebastian's statement should also be true, leading to a consistent scenario where Matthew is indeed a knight and Sebastian is a knave.\n\nSince both scenarios lead to contradictions unless Sebastian is a knave, Sebastian must be a knave.\n\n3. **Matthew's Statement**: \"Chloe is a knave.\"\n   - Since we have already established that Chloe is a knight, Matthew\u2019s statement is false, indicating that Chloe is not a knave.

If Joseph were a knight, Sofia would be a knave; if Joseph were a knave, Sofia would not necessarily be a knave.\n\nFinally, let's look at Sofia's statement:\n- Sofia says that if Noah is a knight, then Sofia is a knave.

Hence, she must be a knave.\n\n- **Charlotte's Statement Analysis**:\n    - If Sophia is a knave, her statement \"Sophia is not a knight\" is true because Sophia is indeed a knave.\n    \nSo far, we have:\n- Sophia = Knave\n- Aiden = Knight\n- Charlotte = Knave\n\nThis scenario does not fit all the conditions given.\n\n### Scenario 2: Aiden is a Knave\n\n- **If Aiden is a Knave**:\n  - From Aiden\u2019s statement: \"Aiden is a knight and Charlotte is a knave.\" This is a contradiction because an individual cannot simultaneously state they are both a knight and a knave.\n  \nTherefore, there is no valid solution where Aiden is a knave.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThere seems to be a logical inconsistency when considering Aiden as a knave. Thus, it is impossible for any of them to be a knight without contradicting themselves under the given conditions.\n\n**Final Result:** NO",

However, this contradicts the fact that Liam himself is saying \"Logan is a knight\" (from his own statement). Therefore, Logan cannot be a knight.\n  \n- Since Logan is not a knight, Sebastian must be a knave because if Logan were a knight, Sebastian would have to be a knave based on Logan's second statement. But since Logan isn't a knight, Sebastian must be a knave to satisfy both conditions of his own statement.\n\n- With Sebastian being a knave, his statement \"Logan is a knight\" must be false. Since Liam is also a knave, his statement \"Logan is a knight\" is true, but it doesn\u2019t contradict anything logically.

If Isabella were a knight, then Daniel would be lying (because he would say she is a knave). Conversely, if Isabella were a knave, then Daniel would also be lying because he would say she is a knight. Therefore, if Daniel says this, Isabella must be one of the two extremes - either a knight or a knave.\n\n- **Isabella\u2019s Statement**: This implies that if Daniel is indeed a knave (which he claims), then Matthew must be a knight. Since Isabella says this, it suggests a logical contradiction unless Daniel is telling the truth about himself being a knave. However, for Isabella's statement to hold true, Daniel cannot be a knave because if he was, he wouldn't have said he was a knave. Thus, Daniel must be a knave, making Isabella a knight since her statement holds when Daniel is known to be a liar.\n\n- **Matthew\u2019s Statement**: If Daniel is a knave, as determined from Daniel's own statement, then his claim about Daniel being a knave aligns with reality.

Since Jackson is telling the truth, we need to check if both parts of his statement can be true simultaneously.\n  - The first part says \"Matthew is a knight,\" which means Matthew is a Knight.\n  - The second part says \"Jackson is a knight,\" but since we assumed Jackson is a Knight, this part cannot be true.\n- Therefore, Jackson cannot be a Knight if he makes this statement. He would contradict himself if he said something like \"Matthew is a knight or I am a knight.\"\n\n#### Case 2: Assume Jackson is a Knave (J = N)\n- If Jackson is a Knave, then his statement \"Matthew is a knight or Jackson is a knight\" must be false because the Knave lies. This implies that neither part of his statement can be true.\n  - The first part says \"Matthew is a knight.\" A Knave does not say this, so this part is false.\n  - The second part says \"Jackson is a knight,\" but since Jackson is a Knave, this part is also false.\n- Therefore, Jackson cannot be a Knave either because lying about both parts would still make him a Knave.\n\nSince Jackson cannot be a Knight or a Knave based on the analysis above, we conclude:\n- Jackson must be a Knave (J = N).\n\nNow, let's use Avery's statement \"Jackson is not a knave\":\n- Avery's statement says \"Jackson is not a knave.\" Since Jackson is a Knave, Avery's statement contradicts itself. Hence, Avery must be a Knight (A = K).\n\nFinally, let's use Matthew's statement \"Avery is a knight or Jackson is a knave\":\n- Matthew's statement says \"Avery is a knight or Jackson is a knave.\" Since Avery is a Knight, this statement becomes \"Knight or Knave",

This means \"Amelia is not a knight\" must be false, which implies Amelia is indeed a knave.\n- If Amelia is a knave, her statement would be false. This means \"Amelia is not a knight\" must be true, but since Amelia is a knave, this part of the statement is always false regardless of what Amelia says.\n\nSince we don't have information about Amelia being a knight or a knave directly, let's assume Amelia could either be a knight or a knave without loss of generality. However, we will check both possibilities later if needed.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Ava's Statement\nNow, consider the case where Amelia is a knight:\n- If Amelia is a knight, she asserts that \"if Amelia is a knave then William is a knave.\" Since Amelia is a knight, this assertion must be true.\n- Therefore, for this case, William must also be a knave because if William were a knight, his assertion (\"Amelia is not a knight\") would be true, contradicting the fact that Amelia is a knight.\n\nThus, in this scenario:\n- Amelia is a knight.\n- William is a knave.\n\n### Step 3: Verify William's Statement\n- William's statement is: \"Amelia is not a knight.\" This is consistent with our conclusion that Amelia is a knight.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that:\n- Amelia is a knight,\n- William is a knave,\n\nand there is no indication that Ava is a knight or a knave based on her initial statement alone.\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\n```\nYES/NO\\ \nRESULT: Amelia,knight,William,knave\n```",

Therefore, Zoey cannot be telling the truth here.\n   \n   - If Zoey is lying, then at least one of the following must be false for her statement:\n     - Sebastian is a knight.\n     - Jacob is a knave.\n   - But since Jacob is asserting that Sebastian is not a knave, if Zoey lies, she must be saying that Sebastian is a knave, which contradicts our assumption that Jacob is a knave.

If she is a knave, her statement would be false, but it doesn't change the fact that she is still a liar.\n\n2. **Harper says**: \"If Harper is a knight then Oliver is a knave.\"\n   - This can be broken down into two parts:\n     - Harper is a knight \u2192 Oliver is a knave.\n     - Harper is a knave \u2192 Oliver is not a knave (which is implied by the original statement since he cannot both be and not be a knave simultaneously).\n\n3. **Oliver says**: \"Harper is a knight and Mia is a knight.\"\n   - This directly confirms the first part of Harper\u2019s statement because if Oliver were to say he believes both parts of Harper's statement, he wouldn\u2019t be contradicting himself.

This means Evelyn could be either a knight or a knave.\n\n#### Subcase 1a: Assume Evelyn is a knight\n- If Evelyn is a knight, then her statement \"Emma is a knight if and only if Emma is a knave\" becomes irrelevant because it would contradict herself (if she were a knight).

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nLet's analyze the statements made by each inhabitant step-by-step:\n\n1. **Sofia**: Said that Luke is a knight.\n   - Since we don't know yet who Luke is, let's denote his type as \\( L \\):\n     - If Luke were a knight (\\(L = \\text{knave}\\)), Sofia would be lying, which means she wouldn't say that Luke is a knight.\n     - If Luke were a knave (\\(L = \\text{knight}\\)), Sofia would be telling the truth, which means she would indeed say that Luke is a knight.\n\n2. **Jackson**: Said that If Sofia is a knave then Luke is a knave.\n   - Let's consider two cases for Sofia:\n     - Case 1: Sofia is a knight.\n       - Then Luke must also be a knight (since if Sofia is a knight, then Luke being a knave contradicts the statement).\n     - Case 2: Sofia is a knave.\n       - According to the statement, if Sofia is a knave, then Luke must be a knave.\n\n3. **Luke**: Said that \"Sofia is a knave if and only if Sofia is a knight\".\n   - This statement implies that both conditions must be true simultaneously:\n     - \\( S \\) (Sofia is a knave)\n     - \\( \\neg S \\) (Sofia is a knight)\n\nSince these statements can't all be true at the same time due to their logical contradiction, we need to determine which one of them is false.\n\nGiven the nature of knights and knaves, let\u2019s check each scenario:\n- If Luke is a knight (\\(L = \\text{knight}\\)):\n  - The first sentence from Sofia says Luke is a knight, which matches since Luke is indeed a knight.\n  - However, according to the second sentence from Jackson, if Sofia is a knave, then Luke is a knave. But Luke is a knight here, so this part doesn\u2019t conflict directly.\n\nIf Luke is a knave (\\(L = \\text{knave}\\)):\n- The first sentence from Sofia says Luke is a knight, which contradicts since Luke is a knave.\n- The second sentence from Jackson states that if Sofia is a knave, then Luke is a knave. This aligns because Luke is indeed a knave, so it holds true.\n\nFrom this analysis:\n- **Luke** cannot be a knight or a kn",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nTo solve this problem, let's analyze each statement made by Jackson, Zoey, and Sophia.\n\n1. **Jackson says:** \"Zoey is a knight.\"\n2. **Zoey says:** \"Jackson is a knave or Zoey is a knight.\"\n3. **Sophia says:** \"Zoey is a knight and Jackson is a knight.\"\n\nFirst, we need to consider the implications of these statements:\n\n- If Jackson is telling the truth (i.e., Zoey is a knight), then according to Jackson's statement, Zoey must indeed be a knight.\n- However, if Zoey were a knight, her statement would contradict herself because she claims both that Jackson is a knave and that she is a knight. This creates a logical paradox where one cannot simultaneously be a knight and say they are a knight while also being a knave.\n\n- Therefore, it can't be the case that Jackson is telling the truth about Zoey being a knight; instead, he must be lying.\n\nNext, since Jackson is lying, his statement \"Zoey is a knight\" is false, meaning Zoey must actually be a knave.\n\nNow, we know Zoey is a knave. Let's evaluate Zoey\u2019s statement:\n- Zoey says, \"Jackson is a knave or Zoey is a knight.\" Since we've established that Zoey is a knave, the part about her being a knight doesn't matter. The crucial part here is that Jackson is a knave. \n\nIf Zoey is a knave, her statement \"Jackson is a knave or Zoey is a knight\" is true because Zoey is lying about Jackson being a knight.\n\nThus, Jackson and Zoey are both knaves.\n\nSince Jackson is a knave, and his statement was supposed to indicate that Zoey is a knight, this means that Jackson is lying about Zoey being a knight.\n\nFinally, Sophia's statement:\n- \"Zoey is a knight and Jackson is a knight.\" \nGiven our conclusion so far, Jackson is definitely not a knight, which contradicts Sophia\u2019s statement.\n\nTherefore, Sophia is lying, implying that either Zoey is not a knight, or Jackson is not a knight.\n\nConsidering all three together:\n- Jackson is a knave.\n- Zoey is a knave.\n- Sophia is a liar, making her statement incorrect.\n\nSo, there seems to be an internal inconsistency among their statements.

This means we need to check if the other statements align with this assumption.\n  \n  - **Noah's Statement**: \"Ava is a knave or Sebastian is a knave.\" Since Ava is a knight, her being a knave would make Noah's statement false because \"Ava is a knave\" is not true. Therefore, for Noah's statement to be true, Sebastian must also be a knight (since he cannot be lying).\n  \n    - **Sebastian's Statement**: \"Noah is a knight.\" Now we know that Noah is a knight (from our previous analysis), so his statement \"Noah is a knight\" is true.\n\n  - We have found a consistent scenario where all three individuals are knights: Ava, Noah, and Sebastian.\n\n#### Case 2: Assume Ava is a Knave (False)\n- If Ava is a knave, then her statement \"Ava is a knight\" must be false.

Therefore, for Noah's statement to be true, Sebastian must also be a knave (because he lies when he says it).\n\n    - **Sebastian's Statement**: \"Noah is a knight.\" Given that Noah is a knave (as per our assumption), Noah cannot be a knight, which contradicts Sebastian's statement (\"Noah is a knight\").\n\nTherefore, the first case where all three are knights does not hold up because of the contradiction in Noah's statement.\n\nSince assuming Ava is a knight leads to a consistent solution without contradictions, the correct conclusion is:\n\n**Solution:** YES\n\n**RESULT:** Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knave, and Ethan is a knave.",

This means either Lucas is a knight (LC) or Amelia is a knave (AK).\n  - If LC = True, then Grace's statement is false because both Grace and Lucas are knights.\n  - Therefore, if Grace is a knight, Amelia cannot be a knave, which contradicts Grace's statement.\n  \nThus, Grace cannot be a knight.\n\n#### Case 2: Assume Grace is a Knave\n- If Grace is a knave, then her statement must be false. This means neither Lucas is a knight nor Amelia is a knave.\n  - Since Grace is a knave, she lies about Grace being a knave or Lucas being a knave.\n  - Therefore, Grace cannot be a knave, and Lucas cannot be a knave.\n\nSince Grace can't be a knave, let's consider Amelia next.\n\n#### Case 3: Assume Amelia is a Knight\n- If Amelia is a knight, then her statement must be true. This means either Grace is a knave (GK) or Lucas is a knave (LK).\n  - If GK = False, then Grace is not a knave, so Grace must be a knight.\n  - However, this would mean Grace tells the truth, contradicting our assumption that Grace is a knave.\n  \nTherefore, Amelia cannot be a knight.\n\n#### Case 4: Assume Amelia is a Knave\n- If Amelia is a knave, then her statement must be false. This means Grace is not a knave (GK) and Lucas is not a knave (LK).\n  - If GK = True, then Grace is a knight.\n  - If LK = False, then Lucas is not a knight, meaning Lucas could be a knave.\n  - In this scenario, Grace\u2019s statement would be false because Grace is a knight but Lucas is a knave, making Grace a liar.\n ",

Therefore, either Evelyn is a knight or Scarlett is a knave.\n\n#### Sub-case 2a: Assume Matthew is a Knight (as Scarlett initially claimed):\n- If Matthew is a knight, his statement about Evelyn being a knight or Scarlett being a knave holds true. But we already know from Scarlett's initial claim that Matthew is a knave. This creates a logical inconsistency.\n\n#### Sub-case 2b: Assume Scarlet is a Knave (which means she lied about Matthew):\n- If Scarlet is a knave, her statement \"Matthew is not a knight\" is false, meaning Matthew is a knight. However, this directly conflicts with Matthew stating \"Evelyn is a knight or Scarlett is a knave.\" If Matthew were a knight, his statement would be true, which implies at least one part of his statement would have to be true (i.e., Evelyn could be a knight).

This means Mia is indeed a knight and a knave simultaneously, which is impossible because an individual cannot be both a knight and a knave at the same time (by definition).\n   - If Victoria is a knave, then both parts of her statement must be false.

Therefore, Matthew could either be a knight or a knave.\n\n- Since Matthew is not a knave from Charlotte\u2019s statement, Sebastian must be a knight (because if he were a knave, Matthew would say \u201cSebastian is a knave,\u201d but that wouldn\u2019t match the actual situation).\n\n- Now, Sebastian is a knight, so his statement must be true.

Therefore, Penelope must be a knave.\n\nThis means we have established two of them as knaves (Lucas and Penelope). Now we need to determine what Emily says about these scenarios.\n\n- If Penelope were a knave, then Lucas would be a liar (since he claims Penelope is a knave), but we already concluded that Penelope is a knave. This makes Lucas's statement logically consistent with Penelope being a knave.\n- If Penelope were a knight, then Lucas would be a knight (because Penelope said that if Penelope is a knave, Lucas is a knight). However, if Penelope were a knight, she would contradict herself in saying \"Lucas is a knight and Penelope is a knight\" since she is a knight and thus not a knight at the same time.

This creates a contradiction because Daniel cannot simultaneously be both a knight and a knave at the same time.\n  \nThus, Daniel cannot be a knight.\n\n**Scenario 2: Daniel is a knave**\n- If Daniel is a knave, then Daniel lies about his own status and about Emily's status as well.\n- Therefore, Daniel is not a knight, so his first part of his statement (\"Daniel is a knight or Daniel is a knave\") is false.\n- Since Daniel is lying, he actually says that \"Daniel is a knave\" is false, meaning Daniel is indeed a knave.\n- Now, according to Emily's statement, since Daniel is a knave, Emily must be a knight (because her statement claims that if Daniel were a knight, she would be a knight).\n- Finally, according to Riley's statement, since Daniel is a knave, Riley\u2019s statement (\"Daniel is a knave or Daniel is a knight\") is false because both parts of the statement contradict each other.\n\nSo, our conclusions based on these contradictions are consistent with Daniel being a knave, Emily being a knight, and Riley being a knave.\n\n**Final Result:**\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO  \nRESULT: Daniel is a knave, Emily is a knight, and Riley is a knave.\n```",

If Harper is a knight, then Logan would be lying about his own status being a knight, which contradicts the fact that he told the truth in his first part (\"Harper is a knave\"). Therefore, Harper cannot be a knight. Since Harper is not a knight, Logan's second part (\"Harper is a knave\") is also false. Hence, Harper must be a knave.\n\n2. **Elizabeth's Statement:** \"Harper is a knave and Logan is a knave.\"\n   - Elizabeth claims that Harper is a knave and Logan is a knave. However, we already established that Harper is a knave. Now let's check if Logan could be a knave as well based on Elizabeth's statement.\n   \n   - If Logan were a knight, then his statement \"Harper is a knave\" would be true (since Harper is indeed a knave).

If Elizabeth is not a knight (i.e., she could either be a knave or an undecided individual), then Luke cannot be a knight because he would contradict his own statement.\n\n2. **Michael's Statement**: \"Elizabeth is a knave and Elizabeth is a knight.\"\n   - This statement is logically contradictory because it claims both that Elizabeth is a knave and that she is a knight simultaneously. Therefore, at least one of these two conditions must be false.\n\n3. **Elizabeth's Statement**: \"Michael is a knave if and only if Luke is a knight.\"\n   - This means that Elizabeth's statement about Michael being a knave depends on whether Luke is a knight. If Luke is a knight, then Michael must be a knave; if Luke is a knave, then Michael must be a knight.

Consequently:\n\n- Jackson is a **knave**.\n- Samuel is a **knight**.\n- Benjamin's statement becomes irrelevant since it depends solely on Samuel being a knight, which we now know to be true.\n\nThus, Benjamin's statement does not provide any additional information that contradicts our previous conclusions about Jackson and Samuel.\n\n**Final Result:**\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nRESULT: Benjamin is a knight, Samuel is a knight\n```",

Therefore, at least one of them must be lying about Victoria being a knave.\n\nSince we know Victoria must be a knave, let's check what happens if Victoria were to make her statement under these conditions:\n\n- If Victoria were a knight, her statement would be false (\"Henry is a knight if and only if Avery is a knave\"). This means that either Henry is not a knight or Avery is a knight.\n- If Henry were a knight, he would contradict himself by saying \"Victoria is a knave\" when he knows she is a knave.\n- If Avery were a knight, he would also contradict himself by saying \"Victoria is a knave\" when he knows she is a knave.\n\nSo, neither Henry nor Avery can be a knight if Victoria is a knight. \n\nGiven that both Henry and Avery are knaves, and Victoria is a knave, we need to determine whether Michael or Zoe are knights. Since none of them can be knights due to the contradictions within their own statements, there seems to be an inconsistency unless we re-evaluate the initial premise of having exactly three individuals making statements.\n\nHowever, given the problem constraints and logical analysis, the most consistent solution is:\n\n**Solution: NO**\n\n**Result:**\n```\nMichael is a knave, Zoe is a knave, Ethan is a knave.\n```",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsys\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by each inhabitant and determine their identities based on whether they are knights (who always tell the truth) or knaves (who always lie).\n\n1. **Emma says:** \"Michael is a knave.\"\n2. **Lily says:** \"Lily is a knight or Emma is a knight.\"\n3. **Michael says:** \"Emma is a knight or Lily is a knave.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### Case 1: Assume Emma is a Knight\n- If Emma is a knight, then her statement \"Michael is a knave\" must be true.\n  - This means Michael is indeed a knave.\n- Now let's check if Lily can also be a knight under this assumption:\n  - According to Lily\u2019s statement, \"Lily is a knight or Emma is a knight,\" since Emma is a knight, this part of the statement is true.\n  - Therefore, Lily could either be a knight or a knave.\n    - If Lily were a knight, both parts of her statement would be true.\n    - If Lily were a knave, the first part (\"Lily is a knight\") would be false, which contradicts our initial condition that she must be a knight.\n\nThus, if Emma is a knight, Lily cannot be a knight; she must be a knave.\n\n#### Case 2: Assume Emma is a Knave\n- If Emma is a knave, then her statement \"Michael is a knave\" must be false.\n  - This means Michael is not a knave.\n  - Therefore, Michael is a knight.\n- Let's now check Lily:\n  - Lily\u2019s statement is \"Lily is a knight or Emma is a knight.\"\n  - Since Emma is a knave, for Lily's statement to hold true, Lily herself must be a knight.\n- Finally, let's verify Michael:\n  - Michael\u2019s statement is \"Emma is a knight or Lily is a knave.\"\n  - As established, Emma is a knave and Lily is a knight, so this statement holds true because it simplifies to \u201cTrue or False,\u201d where True is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nFrom the analysis above, we conclude that:\n- Emma is a knave,\n- Lily is a knight,\n- Michael is a knight.\n\nTherefore, the final result is:\n```\nYES, NO, NO\n```",

Since we have already established that if SAM = T, MK = T, we need to check consistency. \n\nSince Liam states that if SAM = T, MK = T, and Samuel cannot both be a knight and a knave at the same time (as they would contradict each other), it follows that Samuel must be a knight. Thus, MK = T from Liam's statement.\n\nGiven that Samuel is a knight (SK = T):\n- Michael's statement becomes true because he says that Samuel is a knight (\"If L is a knave, then MK is a knave\").\n- If SAM = T, MK = T, so Michael is a knight.\n\nFinally, since Liam is consistent with his statement when Samuel is a knight (and thus Michael is also a knight).\n\nSo the final result is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Michael is a knight, Samuel is a knight, Liam is a knave.\n```",

Let's denote knights as \\( T \\) and knaves as \\( F \\).\n\n1. **Alexander's Statement**: \"If Aiden is a knight then Aiden is a knave.\"\n   - If Aiden is a knight (\\( T \\)), then \"if Aiden is a knight\" is true, so \"Aiden is a knave\" must also be true. This would make Aiden both a knight and a knave, which is impossible since an individual cannot be both a knight and a knave simultaneously.\n   - Therefore, Alexander must be lying when he says \"If Aiden is a knight then Aiden is a knave.\" Hence, Aiden must be a knave (\\( F \\)).\n   \n2. **Aiden's Statement**: \"Charlotte is a knave if and only if Alexander is a knave.\"\n   - Since Aiden is a knave (\\( F \\)), his statement becomes \"Charlotte is not a knave if and only if Alexander is a knave.\" Because Aiden is lying, his statement means that either Charlotte is a knight (\\( T \\)) but Alexander is a knave (\\( F \\)), or Charlotte is a knave (\\( F \\)) but Alexander is a knight (\\( T \\)). However, these two scenarios are mutually exclusive because Alexander can't be both a knight and a knave at the same time. Thus, one of them must be true and the other false.\n\nSince Alexander is a knave (\\( F \\)), his statement implies that the condition for Charlotte being a knave must be false, meaning Charlotte must indeed be a knave (\\( F \\)). Therefore, Alexander and Charlotte are both knaves (\\( F \\)).\n\n3. **Charlotte's Statement**: \"Alexander is a knave or Aiden is a knight.\"\n   - Since Alexander is a knave (\\( F \\)), his statement simplifies to \"Aiden is a knight\" (because \"or\" means exactly one of the conditions must be true). We already determined from Alexander\u2019s statement that Aiden is a knave (\\( F \\)). Therefore, Charlotte\u2019s statement is false because neither part of it holds true under these circumstances.\n\nIn conclusion:\n\n- Alexander is a knave (\\( F \\))\n- Aiden is a knave",

Therefore, Alexander cannot be a knave.\n- If Sophia is a knave, her statement must be false. However, if Sophia is a knave, she would be lying about Alexander being not a knave.\n\nSo, for Sophia to be a knight, Alexander must be a knight. \n\n### Step 2: Check if Sophia is a Knight\nIf Sophia is a knight, her statement holds true. Thus, Alexander must indeed not be a knave. This means Alexander could be either a knight or a knave, but we don't have enough information yet to definitively say which one he is.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Alexander's Statement\n- Since we've established that Sophia is a knight, let's consider whether Alexander is a knight or a knave based on his statement.\n  - If Alexander were a knight, his statement (\"Jacob is a knave or Jacob is a knight\") would be true because both parts of the statement are true (Jacob is a knave).\n  - If Alexander were a knave, his statement would be false.

Emma, however, has no consistent role due to the contradictory nature of her statements.\n\n**Final Result**: Knight, Knave, Knave.",

Therefore, Abigail cannot be a knave.\n\n    - **Sub-case 1b: Oliver is a knave**\n      - Since we already established that Abigail cannot be a knave, the only remaining option for Abigail is to be a knight (because if she were a knave, the entire scenario would contradict itself).

Therefore, Victoria cannot be a knight.\n\n- **If Victoria is a knave**:\n  - In this case, Abigail's claim becomes irrelevant because it depends on Victoria being a knight or a knave.\n  - Victoria claims that Abigail is a knave if and only if Sebastian is a knight.\n    - Since Victoria is a knave, her statement about Abigail is false.

Since we already know from Scarlett's statement that Scarlett could be either a knight or a knave based on Michael's status, let's consider both cases:\n\n   - Case 1: Michael is a knave.\n     - According to Scarlett, if Michael is a knave, then Scarlett is a knave. But we don't have information about Scarlett yet, so we can't conclude anything specific about her.\n   \n   - Case 2: Michael is a knight.\n     - According to Scarlett, if Michael is a knight, then Scarlett is a knave.

However, since Mia said she believes Sebastian is a knight or a knave, her statement itself implies that at least one of them must be true.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nystem\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement made by Grace, Lucas, and Joseph.\n\n1. **Grace's Statement**: \"Joseph is a knight.\"\n2. **Lucas's Statement**: \"Grace is a knight.\"\n3. **Joseph's Statement**: \"Grace is a knight if and only if Lucas is a knight.\"\n\nLet's break it down step-by-step:\n\n- If Grace is a knight (truth-teller), then her statement is true, so Joseph must also be a knight.\n- If Grace is a knave (liar), then her statement is false, so Joseph cannot be a knight.\n\nNow let's consider Lucas's statement. Since he is either a knight or a knave, his statement must match the actual status of Grace being a knight or a knave.\n\n### Case Analysis:\n\n#### Case 1: Grace is a Knight\n- If Grace is a knight, then her statement is true: \"Joseph is a knight.\"\n- This means Joseph is a knight.\n- Now, let's look at Lucas's statement. If Grace is a knight, then Lucas's statement should reflect the fact that Joseph is indeed a knight.\n- However, Lucas's statement is about Grace being a knight. Since Grace is a knight, her statement itself will be consistent regardless of what Lucas says.\n  \nThus, under the assumption that Grace is a knight, everything aligns perfectly because both Grace's and Lucas's statements would be consistent if Grace were telling the truth.\n\n#### Case 2: Grace is a Knave\n- If Grace is a knave, then her statement is false: \"Joseph is a knight.\"\n- This means Joseph is not a knight.\n- Now, let's look at Lucas's statement again. If Grace is a knave, then Lucas's statement claims that Grace is a knight if and only if Lucas is a knight.\n- But since Grace is lying, Lucas can't be a knight (because if he were, Grace wouldn't say she is a knight).\n\nTherefore, if Grace is a knave, Lucas's statement implies that he himself must be a knave as well.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- Grace is a knight.\n- Lucas is a knave.\n- Joseph is a knight.\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Grace,Lucas,Joseph\n```",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsys\nLet's analyze the statements one by one to determine who is a knight and who is a knave.\n\n1. **Charlotte**: \"Liam is a knight if and only if Charlotte is a knight.\"\n   - If Charlotte were a knight, she would say that Liam is a knight. But if Charlotte were a knave, she would lie about this, so we need to consider both possibilities:\n     - If Charlotte says it is true (knight scenario), then Liam must indeed be a knight.\n     - If Charlotte says it is false (knave scenario), then Liam must not be a knight.\n\n2. **Victoria**: \"Charlotte is a knight.\"\n   - This directly states whether Charlotte is a knight or a knave.\n\n3. **Liam**: \"If Charlotte is a knave then Charlotte is a knight.\"\n   - If Charlotte were a knave, then according to Liam\u2019s statement, Charlotte would be a knight, which contradicts our earlier conclusion from Charlotte's first statement. Therefore, Liam must be lying when he claims this, meaning Charlotte cannot be a knave.\n\nFrom Liam's statement:\n- Since Liam is lying, Charlotte cannot be a knave.\n- Hence, Charlotte must be a knight because her statement aligns correctly.\n\nSince Charlotte is a knight:\n- According to Charlotte's statement, Liam must be a knight.\n\nNow let's summarize the results:\n- Charlotte is a knight.\n- Liam is a knight.\n- Victoria cannot be determined based on the given information alone since neither of her statements provides enough clarity regarding her identity.\n\nThus, the solution can be stated as follows:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\\\\\nRESULT: Charlotte is a knight, Liam is a knight\n```",

Therefore, if Olivia were a knight, Aiden would have to be a knave.\n   - If Olivia is a knave (liar), her statement must be false. This means either she is not a knight or Aiden is not a knave.\n\n2. **Henry says**: \"If Aiden is a knight, then Olivia is a knave.\"\n   - If Aiden is a knight (truth-teller), his statement must be true. Therefore, if Aiden were a knight, Olivia would have to be a knave.\n   - If Aiden is a knave (liar), his statement must be false. This means either he is not a knight or Olivia is not a knave.\n\n3. **Aiden says**: \"Henry is a knave and Aiden is a knight.\"\n   - If Aiden is a knight (truth-teller), both parts of his statement must be true. Thus, Henry must be a knave and Aiden must be a knight.\n   - If Aiden is a knave (liar), one part of his statement must be false. Since Aiden cannot be a knight, it implies that Henry is not a knave (so he could be a knight or a knave).\n\nNow let's deduce based on these conditions:\n\n- From Aiden's statement, we know that if he were a knight, Henry must be a knave. But from Henry's statement, since Aiden is indeed a knight (from our previous deduction), Henry being a knave contradicts his own statement unless Aiden was lying initially, which means Henry can't be a knave because if he were, Aiden wouldn\u2019t say he\u2019s a knave.\n\nSo, combining all these:\n- Let's assume Olivia is a knight, thus Aiden must be a knave as per Olivia's statement.\n- Now, considering Henry's statement that if Aiden were a knight, Olivia would be a knave. Since Aiden is a knave, this doesn't contradict anything.\n- Finally, Aiden saying Henry is a knave aligns perfectly with the earlier deductions.\n\nTherefore, Olivia is a knight and Aiden is a knave.",

This implies that there can't be any ambiguity about Scarlett's identity.\n\n2. **Analyze Scarlett's Statement:**\n   - Scarlett claimed, \"Luke is a knight if and only if Luke is a knave.\"\n   - If Scarlett were a knight, she would be telling the truth, so Luke must indeed be a knight and a knave at the same time, which is impossible because a person cannot be both a knight and a knave simultaneously.\n   - Therefore, Scarlett must be a knave. Since Scarlett is a knave, her statement is a lie, implying that Luke is not a knight nor a knave.\n\n3. **Analyze Benjamin's Statement:**\n   - Benjamin asserted, \"Scarlett is a knave if and only if Scarlett is a knight.\"\n   - Since we have established that Scarlett is a knave, her statement is true because a knave will always lie when saying something that is false.\n   - However, since Scarlett is a knave, her statement cannot be true, as it says she is both a knave and a knight, which is contradictory.\n\nGiven these observations:\n\n- **Luke**: If Luke were a knight, Scarlett would be ambiguous. But since we concluded Scarlett is a knave, this part of Luke\u2019s statement does not affect our conclusion directly.\n- **Scarlett**: We determined Scarlett is a knave.\n- **Benjamin**: His statement was incorrectly formulated; however, since Scarlett is a knave, his assertion is irrelevant for determining the identities of Luke and Scarlett.\n\nSince Scarlett is a knave and her statement is incorrect, and Luke and Benjamin\u2019s statements do not provide additional clear information beyond what we already deduced, we conclude that Scarlett is a knave.\n\n**Final Result:** Scarlett is a knave, and no further analysis is needed for Luke or Benjamin, but their statements do not resolve the knave status of Scarlett.\n\n```plaintext\n",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nLet's analyze the statements one by one:\n\n1. **Henry asserts**: \"Sophia is a knave if and only if Sophia is a knight.\"\n2. **Sophia comments**: \"Avery is not a knave.\"\n3. **Avery says**: \"Henry is a knight and Henry is a knave.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Statement from Henry:\n\"Henry asserts\" means that according to Henry's statement, Sophia being either a knight or a knave (but not both) must hold true.\n\n- If Sophia were a knight, then Henry would say it is false (\"Sophia is a knave\"), but this contradicts his assertion because he would have to lie about Sophia being a knave.\n  \n- If Sophia were a knave, then Henry would say it is true (\"Sophia is a knave\"), which again contradicts his assertion because he would have to lie about Sophia being a knight.\n\nTherefore, there is no situation where Henry\u2019s statement could be satisfied simultaneously by any combination of Sophia being a knight or a knave. This implies Henry cannot be certain about Sophia\u2019s identity based on his own assertion.\n\n#### Statement from Sophia:\n\"Sophia comments\": \"Avery is not a knave.\"\n\nThis statement does not provide any direct information about Avery\u2019s identity relative to his other attributes.\n\n#### Statement from Avery:\n\"Avery says\": \"Henry is a knight and Henry is a knave.\"\n\nIf Avery said this, it would mean two contradictory things:\n- Avery claims Henry is a knight.\n- Avery also claims Henry is a knave.\n\nThis leads to a contradiction since an individual cannot simultaneously claim they are a knight and a knave at the same time.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the contradictions found in each of their statements, none of them can be definitively classified as a knight or a knave based solely on what they have stated. Therefore, we cannot determine who is a knight and who is a knave based on these three statements alone.\n\n**Final Result:** NO\n\nSince no valid classification can be made given the provided information, the solution is **NO**.",

This creates an inconsistency.\n\nSince assuming Daniel is a knight leads to contradictions, we conclude that Daniel cannot be a knight.\n\nNext, let's assume Daniel is a knave.\n\n**Assume Daniel is a knave:**\n- According to Sofia\u2019s claim, if Daniel is a knave, then Sofia must be a knave because Daniel is claiming that Sofia is not a knave.\n- Therefore, Sofia must be a knave.\n- Since Sofia is a knave, according to Emma\u2019s claim, if Sofia is a knave, then Daniel must be a knave (but we have already established that Daniel is a knave). This means Emma must also be a knave.\n- Now, since Sofia is a knave and Emma is a knave, according to Daniel\u2019s claim, if Emma is a knave, then Sofia must be a knave, which aligns perfectly with our previous deduction that Sofia is a knave.\n- Finally, if both Emma and Sofia are knaves, and Daniel is a knave, there is no contradiction among them.\n\nTherefore, the correct assignment is:\n- Sofia is a knave,\n- Emma is a knave,\n- Daniel is a knave.\n\nSo, the final result is:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO",

Therefore, it cannot be the case that Daniel is a knave and Michael is a knave.\n\nThus, the only consistent scenario is that Michael is a knight and Daniel is a knave.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nSOLUTION: NO\nRESULT: Michael is a knight, Daniel is a knave\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nRESULT: Michael is a knight, Daniel is a knave\n```",

Therefore, either Michael himself is a knight or Amelia is a knight.\n- If Michael is a knave, his statement must be false. This means that both Michael and Amelia cannot be knights at the same time because it would contradict the fact that one is telling the truth while the other is lying.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude:\n- **Michael could be either a knight or a knave**, but he cannot be both types simultaneously if his statement is to hold true or false as intended.\n\nNow consider the second statement made by William.\n\n- William claims that Michael is not a knight.\n- Since Michael could potentially be a knave, William\u2019s statement might be correct or incorrect depending on Michael's actual nature.\n\nNext, examine Amelia's claim.\n\n- Amelia states that if Michael is a knight, then William is also a knight.\n- We know from Michael's possible scenarios that his statement being true or false depends on him being a knight or a knave.\n\nFinally, let's test some possibilities for Michael:\n\n- **Case 1: Michael is a knight**\n    - His statement (\"Michael is a knight or Amelia is a knight\") is true.\n    - Amelia is indeed a knight since her statement about William aligning with Michael's truthfulness holds when considering Michael as a knight.\n    - Thus, if Michael is a knight, all three individuals (Michael, William, and Amelia) are knights.\n\n- **Case 2: Michael is a knave**\n    - His statement (\"Michael is a knight or Amelia is a knight\") is false.\n    - Amelia is therefore not a knight because she contradicts herself by stating something false when Michael is a knave.\n    - William, however, is still a knave since his statement (\"Michael is not a knight\") is consistent with the assumption that Michael is a knave.\n\nSo, the analysis leads us to two valid conclusions based on",

However, since we know Sophia cannot be a knight from Isabella\u2019s statement, it means Owen cannot be a knight because he can't both say something true about himself being a knight and then contradicting himself by saying Sophia isn\u2019t a knight when she actually is.\n\nThus, Owen must be a knave (liar).\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing Isabella's Statement\n\n- Isabella said Sophia is not a knight.

If Grace says she is a knave, then Penelope must be a knave, and Sofia must be a knight.\n\n2. **Sofia's Statement**: \"Sofia is a knight and Grace is a knight.\"\n   - This directly states that both Sofia and Grace are knights.\n\n3. **Penelope's Statement**: \"Sofia is a knight or Sofia is a knave.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as saying that Sofia cannot be both a knight and a knave because if Sofia were a knight, Penelope would have to be a knave, which contradicts her statement. Therefore, Penelope must be a knave if Sofia is a knight, and Penelope must be a knight if Sofia is a knave. However, since Sofia is described as \"knight and Grace is a knight\" in Grace's statement, Sofia cannot be a knave. Thus, Penelope must be a knave.\n\nNow let's check the consistency of these statements:\n\n- Since Grace says she is a knight (because she is telling the truth), it implies Penelope must be a knight (since Grace is a knight).\n- However, Sofia's statement says Sofia is a knight and Grace is a knight, so Sofia is indeed a knight, which is consistent.\n- Penelope's statement about Sofia being either a knight or a knave is not possible given the previous deductions. \n\nSince Penelope's statement leads to an inconsistency, we must conclude that one of them is lying.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nystem\nLet's analyze the information given step-by-step:\n\n1. **Zoey says, \"Evelyn is a knave if and only if Jackson is a knight.\"**\n   - This statement can be interpreted as follows:\n     - If Evelyn is a knave (false), then Jackson must be a knight (true).\n     - If Evelyn is a knight (true), then Jackson must be a knave (false).\n\n2. **Evelyn says, \"Zoey is a knave.\"**\n   - Since Evelyn said she was lying about Zoey being a knave.\n\n3. **Jackson says, \"Zoey is not a knave.\"**\n   - Since Jackson said he was lying about Zoey being a knave.\n\nNow let's break down each scenario based on these interpretations:\n\n### Scenario 1: Assume Zoey is a knight.\n- If Zoey is a knight, her statement is true.\n  - Therefore, Evelyn cannot be a knave because if she were, Zoey would have to be a knight, which contradicts the assumption that Zoey is a knight.\n\n- From Zoey's statement, Evelyn is indeed a knave (since Zoey is telling the truth).\n- Now we need to check Evelyn's statement: \"Zoey is a knave.\"\n  - But we just concluded that Zoey is a knight, so Evelyn's statement is false, meaning she is a knight, but this creates an inconsistency since we assumed Zoey is a knight and thus Evelyn would be a knave according to Zoey's original statement.\n\n### Scenario 2: Assume Zoey is a knave.\n- If Zoey is a knave, her statement is false.\n  - Therefore, either Evelyn or Jackson could be a knave.\n\n- Let's consider each case separately:\n    1. **If Evelyn is a knave:**\n        - If Evelyn is a knave, her statement is true.\n          - Then, Zoey\u2019s original statement becomes false, implying that both Evelyn and Jackson are knaves.\n        - But this would mean Jackson\u2019s statement is also false, making him a knight. This creates another contradiction.\n\n    2. **If Evelyn is a knight:**\n        - If Evelyn is a knight, her statement is false.\n          - This means Zoey is not a knave.\n          - Since Zoey is a knight, her original statement must be true.

Her statement means that Aurora is not a knave and not a knight. This implies that Aurora could be either a knight or a knave but not both.\n\n#### Aurora's Statement\n- If Aurora were a knight (truth-teller), her statement would mean that Lucas is a knave and Aurora is a knight.\n- Since we already determined that Olivia is a knave (from the contradiction analysis above), this scenario fits logically.\n\nGiven these points:\n- Olivia is a knave.\n- Aurora can be either a knight or a knave.\n- If Aurora is a knight, then Lucas would be a knave (since Olivia is a knave).\n- If Aurora is a knave, then Lucas would still be a knave (consistent with our previous findings).\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is:\n- Olivia is a knave.\n- Aurora is a knight.\n- Lucas is a knave.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n```\nYES/NO\\ \nRESULT: Lucas,knight,Aurora,knight,Olivia,knave\n```",

However, since Liam is a knight, he is always telling the truth, so we can infer:\n- Either Matthew is a knave or Victoria is a knave.\n\nGiven that Liam is a knight, both conditions in his statement must hold true. Therefore:\n- If Matthew is a knave, then Victoria must be a knave because \"Matthew is a knave\" is true.\n- If Matthew is not a knave (i.e., Matthew is a knight), then \"Victoria is a knave\" must be false, which contradicts the fact that Liam is a knight.

However, this contradicts the fact that Amelia is a knight because she cannot lie about herself.\n\nTherefore, Amelia cannot be a knight.\n\n#### Case 2: Assume Amelia is a Knave\n- If Amelia is a knave, then her statement (\"Amelia is a knight and Michael is a knight\") must be false. This means at least one of Michael or Amelia is a liar.\n\n- **If Amelia is a knave**, then her statement \"Amelia is a knight\" is a lie, making it impossible for Amelia to be a knave. Hence, this case leads to a contradiction since Amelia is assumed to be a knave.\n\nSince assuming Amelia is a knave results in a logical inconsistency, Amelia cannot be a knave.\n\n#### Conclusion:\n- Since Amelia cannot be a knight or a knave based on our analysis, Michael and Alexander must be the ones who make truthful statements about themselves.\n\n**Michael's Statement**: \"Amelia is not a knight.\"  \nGiven that Amelia is either a knight or a knave, this statement could potentially be true if Amelia were a knave.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsubject\nTo solve this puzzle, we need to analyze each statement made by Jack, Penelope, and Emily and determine which ones can logically follow from the others given that knights always tell the truth and knaves always lie.\n\n1. **Jack's Statement**: \"Penelope is a knight or Jack is a knight.\"\n2. **Penelope's Statement**: \"Emily is a knight.\"\n3. **Emily's Statement**: \"Jack is not a knight.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Analyzing Emily's Statement\n- If Emily is telling the truth (Knight), then her statement must be true: \"Jack is not a knight.\" This means Jack could either be a knave or an unknown status since no information contradicts it yet.\n- If Emily is lying (Knave), then her statement must be false: \"Jack is not a knight.\" Since Knaves always lie, if Jack is a knave, his statement would be false, implying that Jack isn't a knight. But this doesn\u2019t necessarily contradict anything about Emily being a liar.\n\n#### Analyzing Penelope's Statement\n- If Penelope is telling the truth (Knight), then her statement must be true: \"Emily is a knight.\" Given our analysis of Emily\u2019s possible statuses, she cannot be both a Knight and a Knave at the same time because that would make her statements contradictory.\n- Therefore, if Penelope is telling the truth, Emily must indeed be a knight.\n\n#### Analyzing Jack's Statement\n- If Penelope is telling the truth (Knight), then Penelope's statement must be true: \"Emily is a knight.\" According to the previous analysis, this confirms that Emily is a knight.\n- Now consider Jack's original statement: \"Penelope is a knight or Jack is a knight.\"\n  - Since Penelope is a knight, her \u201cor\u201d part is already true (she is a knight).\n  - The remaining clause, \"Jack is a knight,\" must also be true for Jack\u2019s statement to hold as true.\n\nTherefore:\n- Jack is a knight.\n- Penelope is a knight.\n- Emily is a knight.\n\n### Conclusion\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/\nRESULT: Jack, Penelope, Emily\n```",

If Henry were telling the truth, then Chloe must indeed be a knave. However, if Henry were lying, then Chloe would actually be a knight (since knights always tell the truth).\n\nNext, let's look at William's statement. If he were telling the truth, then both Chloe and Henry must be knights. But since we know from Henry that Chloe cannot be a knight (because it would make his statement false), William can't be telling the truth about Chloe being a knight. Therefore, William must be lying, which means Chloe is not a knight, and thus she must be a knave.\n\nNow we know Chloe is a knave. This means Henry's statement is false because Chloe is a knave.

Therefore, Ethan cannot be a knight.\n\n#### Case 2: Assume Ethan is a Knave\nIf Ethan is a knave, then his statement must be false:\n- \"Joseph is a knave if and only if Alexander is a knave.\"\nSince Ethan is lying, at least one of the parts of the statement must be false:\n\n- Part 1: \"Joseph is a knave\"\n- Part 2: \"Alexander is a knave\"\n\nLet's consider these two scenarios separately:\n\n##### Scenario A: Joseph is a Knave\nIf Joseph is a knave, then his statement about Ethan must be false:\n- \"Ethan is a knave or Ethan is a knight.\"\nSince Joseph is lying, both parts of this statement must be false:\n- Ethan is not a knight and not a knave.\nThis scenario is consistent because it aligns with Joseph being a knave.\n\n##### Scenario B: Alexander is a Knave\nIf Alexander is a knave, then his statement about Joseph must be false:\n- \"Joseph is a knave.\"\nSince Alexander is lying, Joseph must be a knight.\n\nNow, let\u2019s check the consistency with the other statement:\n- Ethan's original statement becomes: \"Joseph is a knave if and only if Alexander is a knave.\" Since Alexander is a knave, the second part is false,",

This means either Oliver or Harper (or both) must be a knight.\n   - If Henry is a knave, then his statement must be false. This means neither Oliver nor Harper can be a knight (i.e., they are both knaves).\n\n2. **Oliver claims:** \"Oliver is a knight or Harper is a knight.\"\n   - If Oliver is a knight, then his statement must be true. This means either Oliver or Harper (or both) must be a knight.\n   - If Oliver is a knave, then his statement must be false. This means neither Oliver nor Harper can be a knight (i.e., they are both knaves).\n\n3. **Harper claims:** \"Oliver is a knave if and only if Henry is a knave.\"\n   - If Harper is a knight, then her statement must be true. This means that if Henry is a knave, Oliver must also be a knave.\n   - If Harper is a knave, then her statement must be false. This means that if Henry is not a knave, Oliver cannot be a knave (which contradicts the previous analysis).\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n- Suppose Henry is a knight. Then Oliver must be a knight or Harper must be a knight. However, if Harper is a knight, Oliver would also need to be a knight, which creates a contradiction since we assumed he is a knight. Therefore, Oliver must be a knave.\n- Now, if Oliver is a knave, his claim \"Oliver is a knight or Harper is a knight\" must be false. Since Oliver is a knave, this implies that both he and Harper are knaves. But this conflicts with the previous assumption that Oliver could be a knight.\n- Thus, Henry cannot be a knight; he must be a knave. Consequently, Oliver must be a knave as well because his claim would contradict himself if he were a knight.\n\nIn this scenario:\n- Henry = Knave\n- Oliver = Knave\n\nThis leaves Harper as the only remaining inhabitant, so she must be a knight.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n```plaintext\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Knave, Knave, Knight\n```\n\nSo",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by each inhabitant step-by-step.\n\n1. **Grace's Statement**: Grace claims she is a knight and Aiden is a knight.\n2. **Aiden's Statement**: Aiden says that if Charlotte is a knave, then Charlotte is a knight. This can also be interpreted as \"if Charlotte is not a knave, then Charlotte is a knight.\"\n3. **Charlotte's Statement**: Charlotte states that \"Aiden is a knight if and only if Grace is a knight.\"\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- Since Grace claimed both she and Aiden are knights, we know Grace tells the truth. Therefore, Grace must indeed be a knight (because knights always tell the truth).\n  \n- Now, since Grace is a knight, her statement that Aiden is a knight is true. Thus, Aiden is a knight.\n\n- With Aiden being a knight, his statement about Charlotte's identity becomes irrelevant because knights always tell the truth. However, Charlotte\u2019s statement implies that if Charlotte were a knave, then it would contradict her own claim of being a knight. Therefore, Charlotte cannot be a knave; otherwise, her statement would be false. Hence, Charlotte must be a knight.\n\n- Finally, since we have determined that Grace and Aiden are both knights, their combined statement \u201cIf Charlotte is a knave then Charlotte is a knight\u201d means nothing because the condition is never met (since Charlotte cannot be a knave).\n\nThus, the final conclusion based on the analysis above is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Michael, Zoey, Ethan\n```",

Therefore, Daniel is lying, which makes him a knave.\n\n3. **Jack made the following statement: \"Olivia is not a knave.\"**\n   \n   If Jack were a knight, his statement would be true.

Elizabeth states that Benjamin is a knave.\n\nLet's consider possible scenarios for each person being either a knight (truth-teller) or a knave (liar).\n\n### Case 1: Assume Sofia is a Knight\n- If Sofia is a knight, her statement is true: Benjamin is not a knave.\n- This means Benjamin could either be a knight or a knave.\n\n#### Sub-case 1.1: Benjamin is a Knight\n- If Benjamin is a knight, his statement must be true because knights always tell the truth. Thus, Benjamin would indeed be a knight, which contradicts our assumption that Benjamin is a knight.\n- Therefore, Benjamin cannot be a knight in this sub-case.\n\n#### Sub-case 1.2: Benjamin is a Knave\n- If Benjamin is a knave, his statement must be false because knaves always lie. Hence, Benjamin is actually a knave.\n- Since we assumed Sofia is a knight and Benjamin is a knave, Sofia\u2019s original claim that Benjamin is not a knave is false.\n- This leads to a contradiction since we assumed Sofia was correct about Benjamin not being a knave.\n\nTherefore, Sofia cannot be a knight.\n\n### Case 2: Assume Sofia is a Knave\n- If Sofia is a knave, her statement is false. This means Benjamin is a knave.\n\n#### Sub-case 2.1: Benjamin is a Knight\n- If Benjamin were a knight, his statement \u201cif he is a knight, then Elizabeth is also a knight\u201d would be true. But it can't be true because Benjamin is already a knave, so Elizabeth cannot be a knight.\n- This creates another contradiction where both Benjamin and Elizabeth are supposed to be knaves but cannot simultaneously be knights.\n\n#### Sub-case 2.2: Benjamin is a Knave\n- If Benjamin were a knave, his statement would be false. However, it doesn\u2019t help us determine anything new since it directly contradicts our assumption of Benjamin as a knave without providing additional information about Elizabeth\u2019s status.\n\nSince none of these cases provide a consistent solution given the constraints, there seems to be an error in interpreting the problem.

Therefore, Victoria must indeed be a knave, and Benjamin must be a knight.\n\n2. **Victoria's Statement**: \"Victoria is a knight if and only if Benjamin is a knave.\"\n   - Since Victoria is a knave, her statement becomes false because she cannot both be a knight and not be a knight at the same time.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nTo solve this problem, let's analyze each statement step by step.\n\n1. **Scarlett's Statement**: \"If Scarlett is a knight then Amelia is a knight.\"\n   - If Scarlett were a knight, then according to her statement, Amelia must also be a knight.\n   - However, if Scarlett were a knave, then according to her statement, Amelia would have to be a knave (since the negation of the implication would make both sides false).\n   \n2. **Isabella's Statement**: \"If Scarlett is a knight then Isabella is a knight.\"\n   - This is similar to Scarlett's statement but for Isabella instead of Amelia.\n   - If Scarlett were a knight, then Isabella must also be a knight.\n   - If Scarlett were a knave, then Isabella would have to be a knave (since the negation of the implication would make both sides false).\n\n3. **Amelia's Statement**: \"Isabella is not a knave.\"\n   - Amelia claims that Isabella is not a knave, which means Isabella must be a knight since knaves always lie.\n\nNow, we need to determine who could be the liar. Let's consider possible scenarios:\n\n- Suppose Scarlett is a knight. Then Amelia must be a knight as well because Scarlett's first statement holds true if she is a knight.\n- Now, if Scarlett is a knight, Isabella must be a knight based on her own statement.\n- Since Isabella is a knight, Amelia's statement (\"Isabella is not a knave\") would contradict herself because she knows Isabella is a knight.\n\nThis creates a contradiction. Therefore, Scarlett cannot be a knight.\n\nSince Scarlett is a knight, Amelia\u2019s assertion is correct: Isabella is a knight. But now, we encounter another inconsistency. If Isabella is a knight, then her statement that \"if Scarlett is a knight then Isabella is a knight\" becomes true, meaning Scarlett indeed has to be a knight as stated earlier.\n\nGiven these contradictions, it appears there might be an error or misunderstanding in the initial setup of the problem. However, considering the logical constraints provided:\n\n**Final Result:**\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nRESULT: Scarlett is a knight, Amelia is a knight\n```",

Therefore, Sophia must be a knight and Aurora must be a knave.\n   - If Grace is a knave, her statement must be false.

Therefore, she could either be a knight or Grace must be a knave.\n   - If Sophia is a knave, her statement must be false. This means that neither Sophia nor Grace can be a knight.

According to her statement:\n\\[ \\text{Aurora is a knight} \\iff (\\text{Matthew is a knave}) \\]\n\nThis implies that Aurora being a knight means that Matthew cannot be a knave. Therefore, if Aurora is a knight, Matthew must be a knight as well.

According to her statement:\n\\[ \\text{Aurora is a knight} \\iff (\\text{Matthew is a knave}) \\]\nThis means that for Aurora\u2019s statement to be false, it must be that Aurora is not a knight but Matthew is a knave.

Therefore, Aurora must be a knave.\n- **Lucas**: His statement logically follows from the fact that Aurora is a knave. He correctly states that Aurora is not a knight and thus Matthew must be a knave (since a knight always tells the truth).\n- **Matthew**: As a knave, he makes a truthful statement about Aurora being a knight, which aligns with his identity of a knave.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO/NONE\nRESULT: Matthew is a knave",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement made by Lucas, Joseph, and Ava and determine their identities based on whether they are knights (truth-tellers) or knaves (liars).\n\n1. **Lucas's Statement**: \"If Joseph is a knight then Ava is a knight.\"\n   - If Joseph is a knight, Ava must also be a knight because it is a true statement.\n   - If Joseph is a knave, Ava must be a liar and therefore not a knight.\n\n2. **Joseph's Statement**: \"Joseph is a knave or Lucas is a knight.\"\n   - If Joseph is a knight, the statement would mean that Lucas is a knight, which contradicts his claim that he is a knave.\n   - If Joseph is a knave, the statement implies that Lucas is a knight, which is consistent with his own claim.\n\n3. **Ava's Statement**: \"I am a knight if and only if Joseph is a knight.\"\n   - If Ava is a knight, the statement means that Joseph is a knight.\n   - If Ava is a knave, the statement would imply that Joseph is a knave, but this does not necessarily follow from Ava being a knave since she could still be lying about her own identity.\n\nLet's break down the possibilities:\n\n- Suppose Joseph is a knight.\n  - From Lucas's statement: \"If Joseph is a knight then Ava is a knight.\" This is true, so Ava must be a knight.\n  - From Ava's statement: \"I am a knight if and only if Joseph is a knight.\" Since Joseph is a knight, this is true, so Ava is indeed a knight.\n  - Now we have two knights (Lucas and Ava), which means Lucas cannot be a knight as per Joseph's statement (\"Joseph is a knave or Lucas is a knight\").\n  - Therefore, Joseph must be a knave.\n\nNow let's summarize the results:\n- Joseph is a knave.\n- Ava is a knight.\n- Lucas is a knight.\n\nSo the final result is: \n```\nYES/LUCAS IS A KNIGHT, JOSEPH IS A KNAVE, AVA IS A KNIGHT\n```",

But if Victoria is a knave, she would also lie about Penelope being a knight, contradicting the initial condition.\n\n3. **Victoria**: \"Penelope is a knight and Penelope is a knave.\"\n   - If Victoria is telling the truth, then Penelope is both a knight and a knave, which is logically impossible because a person cannot be both a knight and a knave at the same time.\n\nGiven these contradictions, we can conclude that there is no consistent set of identities for Penelope, Avery, and Victoria that satisfies all their statements without any contradiction. Therefore, the solution is:\n\n```\nNO\n```",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nLet's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Abigail** said that **Scarlett** is not a knave.\n   - This statement can be written as \\( A \\rightarrow S \\).\n\n2. **David** stated that **Abigail** is not a knight.\n   - This statement can be written as \\( A \\) (since Abigail is either a knight or a knave).\n\n3. **Scarlett** made an assertion about **Abigail** being a knave if and only if she herself is a knight.\n   - This can be written as \\( \\neg A = S \\).\n\nNow let's consider the implications of these statements:\n\n- If \\( A \\) is true (i.e., Abigail is a knight), then according to \\( A \\rightarrow S \\), Scarlett must also be a knight.\n- If \\( A \\) is false (i.e., Abigail is a knave), then according to \\( A \\) (which implies \\( A \\)), Scarlett must also be a knave.\n\nNext, we look at David\u2019s statement:\n- Since \\( A \\) cannot be true (otherwise Scarlett would have to be a knight based on \\( A \\rightarrow S \\)), it follows that \\( A \\) must be false.\n\nSo, \\( A \\) is false, which means Abigail is a knave.\n\nGiven \\( A \\) is false, \\( S \\) (Scarlett) must be true because \\( \\neg A = S \\). Therefore, Scarlett is a knight.\n\nFinally, since Scarlett is a knight, her statement \\( \\neg A = S \\) is consistent with our findings.\n\nThus, the final result is:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO/YES\nRESULT: Scarlett is a knight, Abigail is a knave.\n```",

Therefore, \\( K_C \\) (Charlotte is a knave).\n- According to Emily\u2019s statement, \"If Charlotte is a knave, then Lucas is a knave\", since we assumed \\( K_C \\), it follows that \\( K_L \\) must be false.

Let's denote this as \\( E = \\text{Knight} \\).\n- Then from Victoria's statement, if she is a knave, then her statement about Ethan being a knave is false, implying Ethan is a knight because he lies.

Then William cannot be a knight.\n\nSince William can't be both a knight and a knave (as stated by the rules of knights and knaves), if Jacob is telling the truth, William would have to be a knight. This means that Jacob cannot be a knight because if he were, his statement would be false, which contradicts him being honest. Therefore, Jacob must be a knave.\n\n**Case 2:**\n- If Jacob is lying, then William could be either a knight or a knave. \n\nNow, let's look at Noah's statement:\n**Statement 2:**\n- \"If William is a knight then William is a knave.\"\nThis implies that if William is a knight, he would say \"knave,\" but since knaves always lie, they would say \"knight.\" Thus, it logically follows that if William is a knight, he will contradict himself when he says he is a knave.

Since knights always tell the truth and knaves always lie, if Aurora were telling the truth, Ella would have to be both a knight and a knave, which is impossible. Therefore, Aurora must be lying. Hence, Ella cannot be a knight or a knave; she must be neither.\n\n2. **Matthew**: \"If Aurora is a knight then Matthew is a knight.\" \"If Aurora is a knave then Matthew is a knave.\"\n   - These statements are conditional ones. We need to consider both possibilities for Aurora being either a knight or a knave.\n\n**Case 1: Aurora is a knight**\n- If Aurora is a knight, her statement \"Ella is a knight and Ella is a knave\" must be true. But we already determined that Ella cannot be a knight or a knave. Thus, this case leads to a contradiction because it implies Ella is not a knight or a knave while our earlier analysis showed otherwise.\n\n**Case 2: Aurora is a knave**\n- If Aurora is a knave, her statement \"Ella is a knight and Ella is a knave\" must be false.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nLet's analyze the statements one by one.\n\n1. **Oliver's statement**: \"David is a knight and James is a knight.\"\n2. **David's statement**: \"Oliver is a knave if and only if James is a knave.\" This can be broken down into two parts:\n   - If Oliver is a knave, then James must also be a knave.\n   - If James is a knave, then Oliver must also be a knave.\n3. **James' statement**: \"David is not a knave.\"\n\nFrom these statements, let's deduce who could be a knight and who could be a knave:\n\n- Suppose David is a knight (since he says that):\n  - If David is a knight, then his statement \"Oliver is a knave if and only if James is a knave\" must be true.\n  - This means if Oliver is a knave, James must be a knave, which would contradict our assumption that David is a knight (because if James were a knave, then Oliver being a knave would mean James is indeed a knave, but we assumed David is a knight).\n  - Therefore, David cannot be a knight because it leads to a contradiction.\n\nSince David cannot be a knight, let's consider the case where David is a knave.\n\n- If David is a knave, then his statement \"Oliver is a knave if and only if James is a knave\" must be false.\n  - This means either Oliver is not a knave or James is not a knave.\n  - Let's examine the implications of each part of the statement separately:\n    - If Oliver is not a knave (i.e., Oliver is a knight), then for James' statement \"If Oliver is a knave, then James is a knave\", this is true because James is indeed a knave.\n    - If James is not a knave (i.e., James is a knight), then for Oliver's statement \"If James is a knave, then Oliver is a knave\", this is false because James is actually a knight, so Oliver must be a knave.\n  - In both scenarios (David is a knave and Oliver is a knight, or David is a knave and James is a knight), the conditions for the other person's status align correctly.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n- If David is a knave and Oliver is a knight, then James must be a knave",

Therefore:\n- Harper must be a knight (as stated by Mason).\n- Mason must also be a knight.\n\nHowever, this leads to a contradiction because if both Mason and Harper are knights, then Harper's second part of her own statement (\"Harper is a knight\") would be false (since she claims it's true). This contradicts her own claim that she is truthful.\n\nTherefore, Mason cannot be a knight.\n\n#### Case 2: Assume Mason is a knave.\nIf Mason is a knave, his statement must be false. Therefore:\n- Harper is not a knight (as stated by Mason).\n\nNow let's check the other statements for consistency under this assumption:\n\n**Ava's Statement**: \"Harper is a knight if and only if Mason is a knight.\"\nSince we assumed Mason is a knave, this statement is false because Mason is not a knight, but we know from our previous reasoning that Harper being a knight or not does not affect Ava's statement directly since it only involves Mason's status.\n\n**Harper's Statement**: \"Mason is not a knight.\"\nThis aligns with our earlier conclusion that Mason is a knave.\n\n### Conclusion\nFrom the analysis, we have determined that Mason is a knave, Harper is a knight, and Ava's statement about Harper could either be true or false based on whether Mason is a knight or a knave. However, since our main focus was on identifying knights and knaves, and we've established Mason as a knave, the rest can be deduced accordingly.\n\nFinal Result: Ava is a knight, Harper is a knight.",

Thus, if Zoey were a knight, then \"Zoey is a knight\" would be true, which aligns with Zoey being truthful. Conversely, if Zoey were a knave, then \"Zoey is a knave\" would be true, but this does not contradict Zoey being truthful since knaves always lie.\n\nGiven these analyses, we conclude that:\n- Zoey must be a knave (because Sebastian is not a knight or a knave).\n- Emily must be a knight (since Sebastian\u2019s statement leads us to believe that if Zoey is a knight, then Emily is",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nTo determine who is a knight and who is a knave among Ethan, Scarlett, and Sophia, let's analyze their statements step by step.\n\n1. **Analyze Ethan's Statement**: \"Ethan is a knight or Sophia is a knave.\"\n   - If Ethan is a knight, his statement must be true. This means either \"Ethan is a knight\" (which contradicts itself) or \"Sophia is a knave\".\n   - If Ethan is a knave, his statement must be false. This means \"Ethan is not a knight\" (so he must be a knave), which again leads to a contradiction because if Ethan were a knave, his statement would still be false, meaning \"Sophia is a knave\".\n\n2. **Analyze Scarlett's Statement**: \"Ethan is a knave.\"\n   - Scarlett asserts that Ethan is a knave. Since we've established from Ethan's statement that it cannot be true that Ethan is a knight, Scarlett's statement could potentially be true. However, since she cannot both be telling the truth and lying about Ethan being a knave (because her own statement implies Ethan isn't a knave), Scarlett must be lying.\n   - Therefore, Scarlett's statement must be false, meaning Ethan is indeed a knight.\n\n3. **Analyze Sophia's Statement**: \"Scarlett is a knave.\"\n   - We already know from Scarlett's assertion that she is lying, so Sophia must be a knight (since a liar would say the opposite of what they actually believe).\n\nNow, we can conclude:\n- Ethan is a knight.\n- Scarlett is a knave.\n- Sophia is a knight.\n\nSo the final result is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO  \nRESULT: Ethan,knight,Sophia,knight\n```",

Therefore, Avery cannot be a knave (because knaves always lie).\n   \n2. **Riley's Statement**: \"If Avery is a knave then Sebastian is a knight.\"\n   - This statement can also be interpreted as: \"If Avery is a knave, then Sebastian is a knight.\" If Avery were a knave, Riley would be lying, which means Avery could be either a knight or a knave, but it doesn't affect Sebastian\u2019s identity since we know Sebastian is telling the truth about Avery being not a knave.\n\n3. **Avery's Statement**: \"Riley is a knave or Avery is a knight.\"\n   - Again, this statement can be interpreted as: \"Either Riley is a knave or Avery is a knight.\"\n\nNow, let's combine these insights:\n\n- From Sebastian's statement, Avery cannot be a knave.\n- If Avery were a knave, Riley would have to be a knave because Riley's statement would be false, making Avery a knave itself.

Therefore, Aria cannot be a knight; she must be a knave.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze Zoey's Statement\n\"Zoey noted, \"Sophia is a knave if and only if Aria is a knave.\"\"\n   - If Zoey is a knight (and therefore tells the truth), then the statement \"if and only if\" holds true.\n     - This can be broken down into two separate conditions:\n       1. \"If Aria is a knave, then Sophia is a knave.\"\n       2. \"If Aria is a knight, then Sophia is a knight.\"\n   - Since we've already determined that Aria is a knave, let's check condition 1:\n     - \"If Aria is a knave, then Sophia is a knave.\"\n     - Given that Aria is a knave, this part is true because a knave would lie about anything.\n   - Now check condition 2:\n     - \"If Aria is a knight, then Sophia is a knight.\"\n     - Given that Aria is a knave, this part is false because a knave would lie about anything.\n\nSince Zoey is a knight and satisfies condition 1 but not condition 2, Zoey must be a knight.\n\n#### Step 3:",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nLet's analyze the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Evelyn's statement**: \"Jacob is a knight and Jacob is a knave.\"\n   - If Jacob is a knight (truth-teller), then both parts of his statement must be true. However, if Jacob were a knight, he would not make such contradictory claims about himself being both a knight and a knave simultaneously. This creates a logical contradiction because no one can be both a knight and a knave at the same time.\n   \n2. **Victoria's statement**: \"If Jacob is a knave then Jacob is a knight.\"\n   - Let's consider two cases for Jacob's status based on whether he is a knight or a knave.\n     - Case 1: Jacob is a knight.\n       - If Jacob is a knight, his statement that \"If Jacob is a knave then Jacob is a knight\" is false because the condition \"Jacob is a knave\" cannot be true if we assume Jacob is a knight. Therefore, Jacob cannot be a knight.\n     - Case 2: Jacob is a knave.\n       - If Jacob is a knave, his statement becomes irrelevant as knaves always lie. Hence, there is no need to check further since the truthfulness of this statement does not provide any new information when Jacob is known to be a knave.\n   \n3. **Jacob's statement**: \"Evelyn is a knight and Evelyn is a knave.\"\n   - If Evelyn is a knight, her statement that \"Evelyn is a knight and Evelyn is a knave\" is false because she will contradict herself. Thus, Evelyn cannot be a knight.\n   - If Evelyn is a knave, her statement that \"Evelyn is a knight and Evelyn is a knave\" is also false because she will again contradict herself. Therefore, Evelyn cannot be a knave either.\n\nGiven all these contradictions:\n\n- Evelyn cannot be a knight or a knave due to the inherent self-contradiction in her statements.\n- Since Evelyn cannot be a knight or a knave, Jacob's claim that \"Evelyn is a knight and Evelyn is a knave\" is inherently false if Evelyn exists.\n\nTherefore, none of them could be telling the truth under normal conditions where each individual tells the truth or lies according to their nature.\n\n**CONCLUSION**: NONE OF THEM ARE KNIGHTS OR KNAVES. \n\nSo, the final result is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nRESULT: NONE",

Similarly, if Aurora is not a knave (and hence tells the truth), then Zoey must be a knave (and thus lies).\n   - Since both Abigail and Aurora are either knights or knaves, their statements about each other imply that they cannot both be telling the truth. Therefore, one of them must be a liar.\n\n2. **Aurora's Statement**: \"Abigail is a knave or Zoey is a knave.\"\n   - If Aurora is a knight, her statement would be true because she is telling the truth, which contradicts the fact that at least one of them is a liar.

If Isabella is a knight, then her part of the statement is true.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nLet's analyze the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Harper** said, \"Matthew is not a knave.\" Since knights always tell the truth and knaves always lie, we need to consider two cases for Harper's statement:\n\n   - If Harper is a knight (and therefore telling the truth), then Matthew must indeed not be a knave.\n   - If Harper is a knave (and therefore lying), then Matthew must actually be a knave.\n\n2. **Matthew** said, \"Ella is a knight and Harper is a knight.\" Again, we have two possible scenarios based on whether Matthew is a knight or a knave:\n\n   - If Matthew is a knight (and therefore telling the truth):\n     - Matthew is a knight.\n     - Therefore, Harper must also be a knight (as stated).\n     - This contradicts our assumption about Harper being a knave because if Matthew is telling the truth, Harper cannot be a knave.\n   - If Matthew is a knave (and therefore lying):\n     - Matthew is not a knight (which matches our previous assumption since he was saying something about an individual who must be either a knight or a knave).\n     - However, Matthew lied when he said Harper is a knight, which means Harper is not a knight as per his own statement. But this does not directly contradict our earlier findings regarding Matthew\u2019s identity as a knight.\n\n3. **Ella** claimed, \"Harper is not a knight.\" We can now use Ella's statement to determine Harper's status:\n\n   - If Ella is a knight (and therefore telling the truth):\n     - Harper must not be a knight.\n   - If Ella is a knave (and therefore lying):\n     - Harper must actually be a knight.\n\nNow let's combine these pieces of information:\n\n- From Matthew's statement, we deduced that Matthew is a knight and Harper is a knight.\n- Given Harper's truthful nature from Matthew\u2019s statement, we know Harper is indeed a knight.\n- Since Harper is a knight, Ella\u2019s claim that \u201cHarper is not a knight\u201d would be false according to her own statement, meaning she is a knave.\n\nTherefore, the identities are:\n\n- Matthew is a knight.\n- Ella is a knave.\n- Harper is a knight.\n\nSo, the final result is:\n```\nYES, KNAVE, KNIGHT, KNIGHT\n```",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsubject\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Henry, Logan, and Sofia based on their respective roles as knights or knaves.\n\n1. **Henry's Statement**: \"Sofia is a knight if and only if Sofia is a knave.\"\n   - This statement can be broken down into two parts:\n     - If Sofia is a knight (truth-teller), then she must also be a knave (lie).\n     - If Sofia is a knave (liar), then she must not be a knave (which means she is actually a knight).\n\n2. **Logan's Statement**: \"Sofia is a knight.\"\n   - Since Logan is telling the truth, Sofia must indeed be a knight.\n\n3. **Sofia's Statement**: \"Sofia is a knight and Logan is a knave.\"\n   - Since Sofia is a knight, her statement must be true.

This means either Emma or Logan must be a knave (lying).\n\n#### Statement from Owen:\n- Owen states that if Logan is a knight, then he is also a knight. This implies that if Logan were to be a knight, it would lead to an inconsistent situation because knights always tell the truth, and they cannot both be knights at the same time unless there's no contradiction elsewhere.\n\n#### Statement from Logan:\n- Logan says that if Owen is a knight, then Emma is a knight. Since Owen claims that if Logan is a knight, then he himself is a knight, we can infer that Logan could indeed be a knight if Owen was telling the truth about him being a knight. However, since Logan is lying according to his own statement, it suggests that Owen might be a knave.\n\nNow let\u2019s consider the implications:\n\n1. If Emma is a knight:\n   - Emma would say \"Logan is not a knight.\" But since Emma is a knight, her statement would be true, which contradicts our assumption that Emma is a knight.\n   \n2. Therefore, Emma must be a knave.\n\nSince Emma is a knave, her statement \"Logan is not a knight\" is false. Hence, Logan is a knight.\n\nGiven that Emma is a knave, she cannot be saying anything consistent with herself being truthful. Thus, Emma cannot make the statement \"Logan is not a knight.\"\n\nThis leaves us with two possibilities for Emma:\n- She could be a knight, but this doesn't fit well with her claiming something contradictory.\n- Or she could be a knave, which aligns better with her making a false claim.\n\nConsidering these points, let's move on to Owen:\n\n3. **Owen claims:** \"Logan is a knight if and only if Owen is a knight.\"\n4.

Thus, Evelyn being a knight contradicts her own claim when considering whether she is a knave under the assumption of being a knight.\n\nSince Evelyn claims that if she were a knight, she would be a knave, and given that she can't be a knight while contradicting herself, Evelyn must be a knave.\n\n#### Chloe's Claim\n- Given that Evelyn is a knave, let's re-evaluate Chloe's claim: \"If Evelyn is a knight then Evelyn is a knave.\"\n- Since Evelyn is a knave, the condition \u201cif Evelyn is a knight\u201d becomes irrelevant because there is no possibility for Evelyn to be a knight according to our established facts.\n\nThus, Chloe's claim holds true regardless of what role Evelyn plays.

Therefore, Harper is a knight and Grace is a knave.\n- Check Grace's statement: \"Riley is a knight if and only if Grace is a knight.\"\n  - Since Riley is a knight (from our assumption), this statement would be true because both conditions must hold (i.e., Riley is indeed a knight).\n- However, we have already established that Harper is a knight, which contradicts the fact that Grace is a knave.

Since Aiden claims Avery is a knave, Avery could either be a knight or a knave. But since Aiden himself is claiming to be a knight, he can't be lying about Avery being a knave. Therefore, Aiden must be a knave because he cannot be lying about Avery being a knave while still maintaining that he is a knight.\n\n2. **Ethan's Statement:** \"If Aiden is a knave then Aiden is a knave.\"\n   - If Ethan is telling the truth, then the entire statement is true, meaning Aiden is indeed a knave.

Therefore, either Mason is telling the truth (which means he is indeed a knight) or Mia is a knave.\n   - If Mason is a knave, then his statement must be false. This would mean that neither Mason nor Mia can be a knight (since both cannot be lying simultaneously).\n\n2. **Owen**: \"Owen is a knight if and only if Mia is a knave.\"\n   - This statement implies two things:\n     - If Owen is a knight, then Mia must also be a knight.\n     - If Owen is a knave, then Mia must also be a knave.\n   - Since Owen cannot be both a knight and a knave at the same time, we need to consider the possibility of one being a knight and the other a knave separately.\n\n3. **Mia**: \"Owen is not a knave.\"\n   - If Mia says Owen is not a knave, then Owen must be a knight because knaves always lie.\n\nNow let's combine these insights:\n\n- If Owen were a knight, then according to Owen\u2019s statement, Mia must also be a knight. However, this contradicts our earlier conclusion that Owen cannot be a knight and a knave simultaneously.\n- Therefore, Owen must be a knave, which aligns with Mia's statement that Owen is not a knave.\n\nGiven Owen is a knave, Mia's statement that Owen is not a knave holds true since Owen is indeed a knave. Now we focus on Mason:\n- If Mason is a knight, then his original statement becomes true: \"Mason is a knight or Mia is a knave.\" Since we know Mia is a knave, Mason cannot be a knight (because knights always tell the truth). Therefore, Mason must be a knave.\n- If Mason is a knave, then his statement \"Mason is a knight or Mia is a knave\" is false. Since we have already determined that Mia is a knave, for Mason\u2019s statement to be false, Mason himself must be a knave.\n\nThus, Mason is a knave, and Mia is a knight.\n\n**Final Result:**\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\\ \nRESULT: Mason is a knave, Mia is a knight",

Therefore, either Elizabeth is lying or Matthew is lying about one of the two parts of his statement.\n     - If Elizabeth is telling the truth, then Matthew cannot be a knight (because knights say they are a knight), so Matthew would have to be a knave.\n     - If Elizabeth is lying, then Matthew could be either a knight or a knave (since he says he is not a knight). However, since we already established that Penelope is a knave based on her first statement being false, this scenario doesn't align well with the rest of the puzzle.\n\nGiven these points, let's deduce:\n\n- From Penelope's statement, if she is a knight, Elizabeth is a knave. If she is a knave, Elizabeth is a knight.\n- Elizabeth's statement logically leads us to believe that Matthew must be a knight if Penelope is a knight, but it does not provide any contradiction for Penelope being a knight or knave directly. The key is her own statement which seems inconsistent unless re-evaluated considering the implications.\n\nSince Penelope\u2019s initial statement is crucial:\n- She cannot be both a knight and a knave simultaneously in consistent logical terms. Thus, her consistency suggests an error in assuming her direct truthfulness as independent from other statements without further context checking.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy analyzing the consistency and logical flow across all statements:\n- If Penelope were a knight, Elizabeth would indeed be a knave, making Matthew's claim invalidly self-referential within that framework.\n- Given the direct contradictions arising when trying to reconcile Penelope\u2019s and Elizabeth\u2019s claims under Knight-Knave logic, their roles appear mutually exclusive under standard assumptions of truth-telling/knocking behaviors.\n\nThus, we conclude:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\n\nRESULT: Matthew is a knight, Penelope is a knave, Elizabeth is a knave.\n```",

Therefore, Ella must not be a knave, meaning she could either be a knight or a knave.\n\nNow consider Harper's second part of his statement: \"Harper is a knight,\" which contradicts our previous conclusion that Harper must be a knave according to his first sentence. Hence, Harper cannot be a knight.\n\nGiven that Harper is a knave, we now move on to Samuel\u2019s statement:\n\nSamuel stated, \"If Harper is a knight, then Samuel is a knight; if Harper is a knave, then Samuel is a knave.\"\n\nSince Harper is a knave, it follows from Samuel\u2019s statement that:\n- Harper being a knave implies Samuel is a knave (because if Harper were a knight, Samuel would have to be a knight).\n\nThis aligns perfectly with what Samuel actually said (\"Samuel is a knave if and only if Harper is a knight\").\n\nSo far, we have established:\n- Harper is a knave\n- Ella is neither a knight nor a knave, but we don't need her status to determine the others' roles.\n\nFinally, considering Harper's initial statement again, since we've concluded Harper is a knave, and Samuel confirms that Samuel will indeed say \"if and only if\" Harper is a knight, it means Samuel must be a knight.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n```\nK - Harper is a knave,\nK - Ella is neither a knight nor a knave,\nK - Samuel is a knight.\n```\n\nTherefore, the final result is:\n```\nK,E,N\n```",

Since knights always tell the truth, if Elizabeth is a knight, Evelyn must indeed be a knight. If Elizabeth is a knave, she would be lying, which contradicts her statement.\n\n2. Evelyn claims that both Elizabeth and Harper are knights. This means that since Evelyn is a knight, both of Elizabeth and Harper\u2019s statements must also be true for her to be telling the truth.\n\n3. Harper states that if Elizabeth is a knight, then Elizabeth is a knave. This creates a contradiction because if Elizabeth were a knight (as per Elizabeth's statement), then according to Harper's statement, she would have to be a knave, but we already established from Elizabeth's statement that if Elizabeth were a knight, Evelyn would be a knight, not a knave.\n\nGiven these contradictions, let's determine the roles based on logical consistency:\n\n- If Elizabeth is a knight, then Evelyn must be a knight as well. However, this makes Harper's statement about Elizabeth being a knave false, leading to a contradiction.\n- Therefore, Elizabeth cannot be a knight; she must be a knave.\n\nSince Elizabeth is a knave, her statement that Evelyn is a knight must be false. Thus, Evelyn must be a knave.\n\nHarper's statement says that if Elizabeth is a knight, then Elizabeth is a knave. Since we've determined that Elizabeth is a knave, this statement aligns perfectly with our findings.\n\nSo, the conclusion is:\n- Elizabeth is a knave,\n- Evelyn is a knave,\n- Harper is a knight.\n\nThe final result is:\n```\nknave,knave,knight\n```",

Hence, Elizabeth must be a knave.\n\n3. **Elizabeth puts it:** \"Aria is a knave if and only if Elizabeth is a knight.\"\n   - Since we already determined that Elizabeth is a knave, the statement \"Aria is a knave\" becomes false.

Since we assumed Emma is a knight, Scarlett's statement becomes:\n   - \"Emma is a knight AND David is a knave.\"\n\nSince Emma is a knight (consistent with our assumption), this part of the statement holds true as well.\n\nFinally, consider David's statement: \"Scarlett is not a knave.\" If Scarlett were a knight, she would have said that Emma is a knight. But since Emma is a knight, Scarlett's claim about David being a knave must align with what we know from Emma and Scarlett\u2019s initial statements.\n\nGiven that Emma and Scarlett both agree on Emma being a knight and Scarlett stating that David is a knave, it creates a contradiction because David cannot be both a knave and the one who claims Scarlett isn't a knave without conflict.

Thus, it contradicts itself since he said that at least one of Noah or Logan is a knight.\n  \nSince Benjamin cannot be a knight based on our analysis so far, let\u2019s consider the remaining possibilities for Noah and Logan.\n\n### Final Analysis\n\nGiven that Benjamin is not a knight, we need to check what happens when Noah or Logan is a knave.\n\n#### Sub-case 2.1: Noah is a knave\n- According to Noah\u2019s statement, if Noah is a knave, then Benjamin must be a knave too (since a knave will say something true about Benjamin being a knave).\n- This creates another contradiction since if Noah is a knave, Benjamin must also be a knave.\n\n#### Sub-case 2.2: Logan is a knave\n- According to Logan\u2019s statement, if Noah is a knave, then Benjamin must be a knave (because a knave says something true about Benjamin being a knave).\n- However, this still leaves Noah as a knave, leading to a logical inconsistency where both Noah and Benjamin cannot simultaneously be knights or knaves without creating contradictions.\n\nThus, there appears to be an error in the initial assumptions regarding the nature of their identities.

Therefore, Penelope is a knight.\n- But if Penelope is a knight, she would have said \"Jack is a knight,\" which contradicts Jacob\u2019s statement.\n- Thus, Jacob cannot be a knight.\n\n#### Conclusion:\n- Since Penelope can\u2019t be a knight based on her first statement, and since Jacob can\u2019t be a knight based on his second statement when he assumes Penelope is a knight, there seems no way for either Penelope or Jacob to consistently follow their own statements without contradiction.\n- The only consistent option left is that Jack must be the one lying, meaning he is a knave, and both Penelope and Jacob are knights.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nRESULT: Jacob is a knave, Penelope is a knight, Jack is a knave\n```",

Conversely, if Sophia is a knave, then Jacob cannot be a knave (since knaves always lie), so Jacob must be a knight.\n   \n3. **Jacob\u2019s Statement**:\n   - Jacob says: \"If Sophia is a knight then Sophia is a knave.\"\n     This can be written as \\( \\text{Sophia is a knight} \\rightarrow \\text{Sophia is a knave} \\).\n     If Sophia is a knight, then Jacob\u2019s claim that she is a knave would be true (a contradiction since knights tell the truth), making Sophia a knave. Conversely, if Sophia is a knave, then Jacob's statement that she is a knight would be false (knaves lie), which makes sense. Therefore, if Jacob is a knight, he tells the truth about Sophia being a knave; otherwise, he lies and claims Sophia is a knight, but since we know from Sophia's statement that she is indeed a knave when Jacob is a knight, Jacob must be a knight.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - From the analysis, we see that both Sophia and Jacob are knights, while Aria is a knave.\n\nSo, the final result is:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\\ \nRESULT: Aria,knight,Sophia,knight,Jacob,knight\n```",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsys\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether each of the three individuals (Harper, James, and William) is a knight or a knave based on their statements.\n\n1. **Harper's Statement**: Harper says either James is a knave or James is a knight.\n   - This means that if James were a knave, Harper would say something false, but since Harper is truthful, James must not be a knave. Therefore, James cannot be a knave because it would make Harper's statement false if James was indeed a knave. Thus, James must be a knight.\n\n2. **James' Statement**: James says either Harper is a knight or William is a knight.\n   - Since we have already determined that James is a knight, his statement simplifies to \"Harper is a knight\" (because he knows for certain that James is a knight). If Harper were a knave, James would lie about Harper being a knight, which contradicts the fact that James is telling the truth. Therefore, Harper must be a knight.\n\n3. **William's Statement**: William says \"If James is a knave then Harper is a knight.\"\n   - Given that we know James is a knight, William's statement becomes \"False\" because James is not a knave (since he is a knight), so the condition \"If James is a knave then Harper is a knight\" is never true. However, since William is telling the truth, his statement must be true when interpreted correctly. But since James is a knight, the implication \"If James is a knave then Harper is a knight\" is false, meaning William's statement is actually a contradiction under the given conditions.\n\nFrom the above analysis:\n\n- Harper is a knight.\n- James is a knight.\n- William is a knave.\n\nSo the final answer is:\n```\nYES/NO\nRESULT: knight,knight,knave\n```",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nTo solve this problem, let's analyze each statement step-by-step.\n\n1. **Lucas' Statement:** \"If Lucas is a knight then Scarlett is a knave.\"\n   - This can be broken down into two parts:\n     - If Lucas is a knight, then Scarlett must be a knave.\n     - If Lucas is a knave, then Scarlett must be a knight (because a knave lies).\n\n2. **Harper's Statement:** \"Scarlett is a knight.\"\n   - Since Harper says that Scarlett is a knight, we know for sure that Scarlett is indeed a knight based on this statement alone.\n\n3. **Scarlett's Statement:** \"Lucas is not a knight.\"\n   - This means that if Lucas were a knight, it would lead to a contradiction because according to Lucas\u2019 first statement, if he is a knight, then Scarlett must be a knave. However, since we already established that Scarlett is a knight, there cannot be any inconsistency here.\n\nGiven these points, let's re-evaluate Lucas' statement:\n\n- If Lucas is a knight (which matches his own claim), then Scarlett must be a knave.\n- But if Lucas is a knave (contrary to his own claim), then Scarlett must be a knight.\n\nSince we know from Harper's statement that Scarlett is a knight, and from Lucas' statement that if Lucas is a knight, then Scarlett must be a knave, we need to resolve this contradiction.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- If Lucas is a knave, then Scarlett must be a knight as per Lucas' statement.\n- However, if Lucas is a knave, his statement about Scarlet being a knave contradicts Harper\u2019s statement that Scarlett is a knight.\n\nTherefore, Lucas must be a knight.\n\nSo, the correct assignment is:\n```\nLucas is a knight, Harper is a knight, and Scarlett is a knave.\n```",

So, if Owen is a knight, Jack must indeed be a knave. Let's check Jack's statement under this assumption:\n  - If Owen is a knight and Jack is a knave, then Jack's statement \"Oliver is a knight and Oliver is a knave\" would be false because it claims both conditions are true when they are actually contradictory. This creates a contradiction.\n\nSince assuming Oliver as a knight leads to a contradiction, Oliver cannot be a knight.\n\n#### Case 2: Assume Oliver is a Knave (He always lies).\n- If Oliver is a knave, his statement must be false. So, if Owen is not a knight, Jack cannot be a knave. We will see how this affects the other two statements:\n  - Since Oliver is a knave, he lies about his own statement. Therefore, the condition \"If Owen is a knight then Jack is a knave\" being false means that Owen must be a knave.

Therefore, Avery cannot be telling the truth because it creates a paradox.\n\n2. **Since Avery is not telling the truth**, let\u2019s assume he is lying.\n   - If Avery is lying, one of his statements must be false.\n   - The first part of Avery's statement is \"Aurora is a knight.\" Since Avery is lying, Aurora must be a knave (because if she were a knight, Avery would not be lying about her being a knight).\n\n3. **Conclusion from Avery's Lying Statement**:\n   - If Aurora is a knave, then her first part of the statement is false: \"Aurora is a knight\" is false.\n   - Her second part of the statement is \"Aurora is a knight or Aurora is a knave.\" Since we already established that Aurora is a knave, the second part becomes \"false or true,\" which is still true. However, since we assumed Avery lied, we know that the entire statement is false, making the first part of Avery's statement false as well.\n\n4. **Checking David's Statement**:\n   - David said, \"Aurora is a knight if and only if Avery is a knight.\"\n   - If Aurora were a knight, then the statement would be true because the condition \"if and only if\" means the same thing in both directions.\n   - Since we determined Aurora is a knave, we substitute this into David's statement: \"A knave is a knight if and only if a knight is a knight.\"\n\n5. **Final Analysis**:\n   - A knave cannot be a knight, so the second half of David's statement (which would make the whole statement true) is",

Thus, assuming both Owen and Luke are knights leads to an internal contradiction. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\n**Case 2:** Assume Owen is a knave (O=K).\n- If O=K, then according to Luke's claim, Owen's statement must be false. This means Owen's statement implies at least one of his parts is false.\n- According to Owen's claim, for his statement to be false, either Benjamin is a knight (B=K) or Luke is a knave (L=K).\n- Since we already assumed Owen is a knave, his statement being false does not affect our conclusion about whether Luke or Benjamin is a knight or knave.\n\nNow let's check the remaining possibilities:\n\n**Case 3:** Assume Owen is a knight but Luke is a knave (O=K, L=K).\n- If Owen is a knight and Luke is a knave, then Owen's claim is false because neither part of his statement is true when considering the roles of Benjamin and himself as described.\n- This aligns with the scenario where Owen is a knight and Luke is a knave, satisfying Owen's claim that Benjamin is a knight (since Benjamin was indeed a knave).\n\nTherefore, we conclude:\n\n",

This means two things:\n- If Grace is a knight (which implies she is telling the truth), then Chloe must also be a knave.\n- If Grace is not a knight (which implies she is lying), then Chloe must actually be a knight.\n\nIf Grace is a knight:\n- Chloe would have to be a knave according to Grace\u2019s statement.\n\nIf Grace is not a knight (a liar):\n- The contrapositive of Grace's statement would be true, so Chloe would indeed be a knight.\n\nSo, we have two possibilities for Grace:\n- Grace is a knight, which makes Chloe a knave.\n- Grace is a liar, which makes Chloe a knight.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Emma's Statement\n\nEmma says that Grace is a knight and Chloe is a knight. Let's consider both cases from Step 1.\n\n#### Case 1: Grace is a knight\n- If Grace is a knight, then Chloe must be a knave (as per Grace's statement).\n- Therefore, Emma's statement (\"Grace is a knight and Chloe is a knight\") does not hold because Grace is not a knight.\n\n#### Case 2: Grace is a liar\n- If Grace is a liar, then the opposite of her statement must be true. Hence, Grace is not a knight, which contradicts our assumption that Grace is a liar (since we assumed Grace was lying). Thus, there's no contradiction here, but since Grace is a liar, the other part of Grace's statement (that Chloe is a knight) must be false.\n\nGiven these contradictions, neither case works out as expected under Grace being a liar. However, since Grace is a liar, Emma's statement cannot be true based on Grace's initial claim about Chloe being a knight. Therefore, Grace cannot be a knight; hence, Grace must be a liar.\n\n### Conclusion\nSince Grace is a liar, we can now determine Chloe and Emma:\n- Grace is a liar, so Grace's statement that Chloe",

However, since he is lying, we need to check if his statement holds when Aurora is indeed a knave.\n\nIf Aurora were a knight, then Samuel being a knight would be true, which contradicts our assumption that Samuel is a knave.

This creates a contradiction because if Benjamin is a knave, he cannot both be a knave and have a knight as a friend. Therefore, Owen must be a liar.\n\nIf Owen is a liar, then his statement \"Benjamin is a knave and Owen is a knight\" must be false.

Therefore, Ava cannot be a knight.\n  \n- If Ava is a knave, then Sophia must be a knight (since Ava's assertion holds true when Sophia is a knight). Now we need to check whether Sophia's and Aiden's statements are consistent under this assumption.\n\n- From Sophia's statement (\\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\)), since Sophia is a knight, it follows that \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) is true. This means that \\( A \\vee B \\) is true, so at least one of them must be a knight. Since Ava is a knave, Aiden must be a knight (as per his statement).\n\nSo, we have determined that:\n- Ava is a knave,\n- Sophia is a knight,\n- Aiden is a knight.\n\nThus, the final result is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\nRESULT: Aiden,knight,Sophia,knight,Ava,knave\n```",

But from Victoria\u2019s statement, if she were a knight, both Sofia and Scarlett would have to be knaves, which contradicts Scarlett saying Sofia isn't a knight.

This creates a contradiction since we assumed Daniel is a knave. Therefore, Daniel can't be a knave. Hence, Daniel must be a knight.\n\n2. **Oliver says:** \"Daniel is not a knave.\"\n   - Since we have established that Daniel is a knight, it follows that Daniel is telling the truth about himself, so he is indeed not a knave. This statement from Oliver aligns perfectly with our conclusion that Daniel is a knight.\n\n3. **Riley asserts:** \"Daniel is a knave if and only if Riley is a knight.\"\n   - This implies two things: \n     - If Daniel is a knave, then Riley must also be a knave.\n     - If Daniel is a knight, then Riley must also be a knight.\n   - We already know that Daniel is a knight.

This means either Noah is indeed a knight (which contradicts Mia's statement) or Mason is a knight.\n  \n- If Noah is a knave, then his statement must be false. This means neither Noah nor Mason can both be knights because it would mean their disjunction (both being knights implies they cannot both be) is not possible.\n\n- If Mia is a knight, her statement about Noah being a knight if and only if Mason is a knave must be true. This means both conditions hold simultaneously for Noah and Mason\u2019s identities:\n  - Noah could be a knight,\n  - Mason could be a knave.\n\n- If Mia is a knave, her statement must be false. This means either Noah is not a knight or Mason is a knight (or both).\n\nNow let's test these scenarios:\n\n#### Case 1: Assume Noah is a knight.\n- If Noah is a knight, he tells the truth when saying \"Noah is a knight or Mason is a knight.\" Since we assumed Noah is a knight, the statement holds true.\n- However, this leads to a contradiction since Mia also claims that Noah is a knight and Mason is a knave, which would make Mia\u2019s statement false according to her own claim.\n\nSo, assuming Noah is a knight doesn't work.\n\n#### Case 2: Assume Noah is a knave.\n- If Noah is a knave, his statement \"Noah is a knight or Mason is a knight\" must be false. This means both parts cannot be true simultaneously.\n  - Therefore, Noah cannot be a knight.\n  - Hence, Mason must be a knight as per the second part of Noah's statement.\n\nSince Mason is a knight and Noah is a knave, let's verify the other two statements:\n- Mia says, \"Noah is a knight if and only if Mason is a knave.\" This is true because Noah is a knave and Mason is a knight.\n- Mason says, \"Mia is a knight.\" This is true because Mia is a knight.\n\nTherefore, Noah is a knave",

However, this again contradicts the definition of a knight since they always tell the truth. Therefore, Oliver cannot be a knave either.\n\n2. **Ella's Statement**: \"Jackson is a knight.\"\n   - Since we have established that Jackson cannot be a knight (as per Jackson's first part of his statement), Ella's statement directly implies that Jackson is not a knight. Therefore, Jackson is a knave.\n\n3. **Oliver's Statement**: \"Ella is a knave or Jackson is a knave.\"\n   - We already know from Ella's statement that Jackson is a knave.\n   - According to Oliver's statement, Ella must be a knave because if she were a knight, Jackson would have to be a knight as well, which is impossible since we've determined Jackson is a knave.\n   \nBased on these deductions, we conclude:\n\n- Jackson is a knave.\n- Ella is a knave.\n- Oliver is a knight.\n\nThus, the final result is:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO/NY\nRESULT: Knight, Knave, Knight\n```",

However, if James were a knave (liar), then his statement would be false because it means that Emma cannot be a knight even though James is a knight.

But since we already know from the first statement that James can't be a knave, James must be a knight. Then, Emma would indeed be a knight according to James' second statement.\n- If James were a knave, then Emma would have to be a knave for James\u2019 second statement to hold true.

Therefore, Matthew cannot be a knight because then his statement would be false, which contradicts the condition of being a knight. So, Matthew must be a knave.\n\n2. **Lily says, \"Matthew is a knave if and only if Mason is a knight\"**.\n\n   If Lily is telling the truth, her statement holds true, meaning Matthew is indeed a knave and Mason is a knight. However, we already established that Matthew is a knave, so Lily\u2019s statement would be false, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, Lily must be lying, which implies that Matthew is actually a knight and Mason is a knave.\n\n3. **Mason says, \"Matthew is not a knight\"**.\n\n   Since we determined that Matthew is a knave, Mason's statement is also false, making him a liar.\n\nSo, Matthew is a knight and Mason is a knave.

Hence, Lily cannot be a knight.\n\n**Assume Lily is a Knave**:\n- If Lily is a knave, then her statement must be false.\n- Therefore, either Victoria is not a knight or Scarlett is not a knave.\n\nLet's consider both cases:\n\n#### Case 1: Assume Victoria is a Knight\n- If Victoria is a knight, then her statement must be true.\n- Therefore, Scarlett must be a knave (because if she were a knight, her statement would also have to be true).\n\nNow, check Scarlett's statement:\n- Scarlett claims that Victoria is a knave and Lily is a knight.\n- Since Victoria is indeed a knight, Scarlett's statement is false, which means Scarlett must be a knave.\n\nThis scenario does not contradict any other information, so it could be possible.\n\n#### Case 2: Assume Victoria is a Knave\n- If Victoria is a knave, then her statement must be false.\n- Therefore, Scarlett must be a knight (because if she were a knave, her statement would also have to be true).\n\nNow, check Scarlett's statement:\n- Scarlett claims that Victoria is a knave and Lily is a knight.\n- This makes Scarlett's statement false, which means Scarlett must be a knave.\n\nIn this case, Victoria is still a knave, but Scarlett and Lily are both knights.\n\n### Conclusion\nFrom these analyses, we see that the most consistent scenario where all conditions hold true without contradiction is when Victoria is a knave, Scarlett is",

Therefore, Sebastian cannot be a knight.\n\n**Assume Sebastian is a knave:**  \n- Since Sebastian lies, if Grace is a knight, he will claim it\u2019s false, meaning Grace isn't actually a knight (contradiction).

This means Sebastian could not have been telling the truth here because his assertion conflicts with Grace's identity as a knight.\n\n#### Scenario 2: Assume Grace is a knave.\n- Given Owen's statement, Grace must be either a knight or Owen is a knight.

This doesn't provide any contradiction since he can't both be truthful and lying about the same thing.\n   - However, if Michael were lying (i.e., Penelope is actually a knight), then his statement would be false, meaning Penelope isn't a knave.

But since Penelope is lying, she cannot be stating that Oliver is a knave while simultaneously saying that Oliver is not a knave unless Oliver was initially a knight which contradicts our assumption.\n     - Therefore, Oliver must be a knave.\n     - Since Oliver is a knave, Penelope\u2019s statement becomes \u201cOliver is a knave\u201d (which is consistent) and thus her statement holds true.\n     - This leaves us with Michael as the knight since Penelope is telling the truth.\n\n3. **Oliver's Statement**: \"If Michael is a knave then Michael is a knight.\"\n   - If Michael were a knave, then Oliver\u2019s statement would be false (since it claims that if Michael is a knave, Michael is a knight).\n   - However, since we concluded Michael is a knight, Oliver\u2019s statement should be true (because the antecedent is false). Thus, Oliver\u2019s statement aligns perfectly with reality given that Michael is indeed a knight.\n\nFrom all these analyses, we can conclude:\n\n- **Michael** is a knight.\n- **Penelope** is a knave.\n- **Oliver** is a knight.\n\nSo the solution is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\nRESULT: Michael is a knight, Penelope is",

However, this would contradict the fact that knights always tell the truth. Therefore, Ella cannot be a knight.\n\nNext, let's check if Ella could be a knave.\n\n- If Ella were a knave, her statement would be false. This means that Mason must not be a knave (since a knight always tells the truth about others being knights), which aligns with our assumption that Mason is a knight. Additionally, if Mason is a knight and Ella is a knave, and Ella says that Mason is a knave, this is consistent because knaves lie.\n\nNow, let's verify the consistency of the situation where Ella is a knave:\n- If Ella is a knave, her statement \"Mason is a knave\" is false. Since a knight always tells the truth, this implies that Mason is a knight, which contradicts our previous conclusion that Mason is a knight.\n- Therefore, Ella cannot be a knave either.\n\nSince neither Ella nor Mason can be a knave based on the given conditions, they both must be knights.

Therefore, Olivia cannot be both a knight and a knave at the same time; hence, one must be a knight and the other a knave.\n\nSince Emily is a knight, her statement is true:\n- If Olivia is a knight, then her statement \"Emily is a knight or Harper is a knight\" must also be true.\n  - Since Emily is indeed a knight, this makes sense.\n- If Olivia is a knave, then her statement \"Emily is a knight or Harper is a knight\" would be false, but given that Emily is a knight, this does not fit logically because a knight cannot say something false.\n\nThus, the only consistent scenario is:\n- **Emily",

If Oliver is not a knave, he could be a knight or a knave:\n\n- If Oliver is a knight, his statement \"I am a knight\" is true, which aligns with our assumption.\n- If Oliver is a knave, his statement \"I am a knight\" is false, but since knaves always lie, saying \"I am a knight\" would still be a lie from the knave\u2019s perspective, which doesn\u2019t contradict anything directly related to us.\n\nGiven that Oliver isn't a knave, we move forward assuming Oliver might be a knight or a knave.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Oliver's Statement\n\n- If Oliver were a knight, his statement \"I am a knight\" is true.\n- If Oliver were a knave, his statement \"I am a knight\" is false, implying \"I am not a knight,\" which again aligns with being a knave.\n\nNow, considering the implications for Matthew:\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Matthew's Statement\n\n- If Matthew were a knight, his statement \"If Matthew is a knight, then Oliver is a knight\" is true because a knight always tells the truth.\n- If Matthew were a knave, his statement \"If Matthew is a knight, then Oliver is a knight\" is false because a knave lies.\n\nTo determine what Oliver is, we need to",

Therefore, Penelope must be a knave.\n\nSo far, we have:\n- Victoria = Knight\n- Liam = Knave\n\nNow, let's check Liam's statement:\n- Liam claims: \"Penelope is a knight or Penelope is a knave.\"\n\nSince Liam is a knave, his statement must be false. Thus, Penelope must not be a knight and not a knave. But since we already know Penelope is a knave from the previous steps, this scenario is impossible.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Assume Victoria is a knave.\n  - Her statement is false because she cannot both claim to be a knight and a knave at the same time.\n  - Therefore, the rest of the conditions for her statement do not hold true.\n\nGiven these contradictions in Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, there is no consistent assignment of roles that satisfies all three statements.

Therefore, Elizabeth must indeed be a knave because James said she is a knave.\n- This means Mason cannot be a knight because James already stated that Elizabeth is a knave, so Mason could not have been lying about being a knight. Thus, Mason must be a knave.\n- Now we know James is a knight, Elizabeth is a knave, and Mason is a knave. We need to check if these statements fit:\n  - James' statement: \"Elizabeth is a knave and Mason is a knight.\" This is false because Elizabeth is a knave, but Mason is not a knight.\n  - Mason's statement: \"Elizabeth is a knave.\" This is true because Elizabeth is a knave.\n  - Elizabeth's statement: \"If James is a knave then Elizabeth is a knight.\" This is true because James is a knight, which makes Elizabeth's claim logically consistent.\n\nSince one of the conditions leads to contradiction when assuming James is a knight, this case is invalid.\n\n### Case 2: Assume James is a knave (i.e., he lies)\n- If James is a knave, his statement must be false. Therefore, at least one of the two parts of his statement must be false.\n- Let's consider the possibilities:\n  - If Elizabeth is a knave, then her statement \"If James is a knave then Elizabeth is a knight\" would be true because it does not contradict anything. But this contradicts the fact that James is a knave.\n  - If Elizabeth is a knight, then her statement \"If James is a knave then Elizabeth is a knight\" would also be true because it does not contradict anything. And here, James would also say his statement is true, which would be inconsistent since James lied in his first statement.\n\nSince both sub-cases lead to contradictions, this case is also invalid.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth cases lead to contradictions, meaning",

Since she lies, she would claim that \"Elizabeth is a knave\" when she is actually a knave.\n\n2. **Jack's Claim**: \"Elizabeth is a knave if and only if Elizabeth is a knight.\"\n   - If Elizabeth is a knight (truth-teller), then her statement must be true, meaning she would say \"Elizabeth is a knave\" or \"Elizabeth is a knight\".\n   - However, if Elizabeth is a knave (liar), her statement must be false, which means she would actually say the opposite of what she thinks. Since she lies, she would claim that \"Elizabeth is a knight\" when she is actually a knave.\n\n3. **Elizabeth's Claim**: \"Elizabeth is a knight and Jack is a knight.\"\n\nNow let's consider the implications:\n\n- If Elizabeth were a knight, then her claim \"Elizabeth is a knight and Jack is a knight\" would be true because both parts of the statement are true for a knight.\n- However, if Elizabeth were a knave, then her claim would be false because the second part (\"Jack is a knight\") would be true but the first part (\"Elizabeth is a knight\") would be false.\n\nSince Elizabeth cannot be both a knight and a knave simultaneously, we need to determine which one is truthful and which one is lying based on the given information.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- If Elizabeth were a knight, her claim \"Elizabeth is a knight and Jack is a knight\" would be true, implying that both Elizabeth and Jack are knights.\n- But then William's and Jack's claims about Elizabeth being a knave contradict the assumption that they are knights. This creates a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, Elizabeth must be a knave because if she were a knight, her claim would be false, leading to inconsistencies.\n\nSince Elizabeth is a knave, William's claim \"Elizabeth is a knave if and only if Elizabeth is a knave\" is true because it aligns with Elizabeth being a",

Therefore, Avery must be a knave.\n\nNow we know:\n- Avery is a knave.\n- Sofia is a knave.\n\nSince we already concluded that Avery and Sofia are knaves, let's re-evaluate Emma's statement under these conditions:\n- Emma cannot be telling the truth because Avery is a knave, so at least one of her claims must be false.\n- If Emma were to say \"Avery is a knight,\" it would be a lie since we've established that Avery is a knave.\n\nThus, Emma's statement is true, which means her first part is correct but her second part is false.

But this contradicts our assumption that David is a knight. Therefore, David cannot be a knight.\n\n#### Case 2: Assume David is a Knave (N)\n- From David\u2019s statement: If David is a knight (\\( K \\)), then Ethan must be a knave (\\( N_E \\)). However, since we assumed David is a knave, his statement does not provide any new information about Ethan being a knave because both conditions (being a knight or a knave) are true for him as a knave. Thus, this case remains inconclusive on its own.\n\nSince assuming David is a knight leads to a contradiction, let us re-evaluate under different assumptions.\n\n#### Reconsidering:\nGiven David\u2019s statement: If David is a knight, then Ethan must be a knave. Since we know David is a knave, his statement becomes irrelevant.

Therefore, Grace cannot be a knight; she must be a knave.\n\n2. **Abigail**: Grace is not a knave.\n   - Since we already concluded that Grace is a knave, Abigail\u2019s statement is false. This means Grace could either be a knight or a knave. However, since we have established Grace as a knave, there is no contradiction here, but it does not provide new information about Abigail's status directly from Grace's statement alone.\n\n3. **Riley**: Riley is not a knave.\n   - Riley's statement is ambiguous because both possibilities for Grace (knight or knave) do not contradict Riley's statement. We need to consider each possibility separately:\n\n     - **Case 1: Grace is a knight**:\n       - If Grace is a knight, her statement (\"Grace is a knight\") is true.\n       - Then Abigail is a knave (as Grace said).\n       - This satisfies all conditions: Grace says Grace is a knight, which is true, and Abigail is a knave. Riley's statement also holds true if he is a knight.\n\n     - **Case 2: Grace is a knave**:\n       - If Grace is a knave, her statement (\"Grace is a knight\") is false.\n       - Then Abigail is not a knave, so Abigail must be a knight.\n       - This satisfies all conditions: Grace says Grace is a knave, which is false, and Abigail is a knight. Riley's statement also holds true if he is a knave.\n\nGiven these two cases, we see that both scenarios satisfy all the given statements. Thus, there can be multiple solutions depending on whether Grace is a knight or a knave.\n\n**FINAL RESULT:**\n- Grace is a knave,\n- Riley is a knave,\n- Abigail is a knight.",

This means either Riley is a knight or Isabella is a knight.\n   - If Amelia is a knave, then her statement must be false. This would mean that neither Riley nor Isabella is a knight, which contradicts her being a knave if she were telling the truth about one of them (either Riley or Isabella).\n\n2. **Isabella's Statement**: \"Riley is a knave.\"\n   - If Isabella is a knight, then her statement must be true. This means Riley is indeed a knave.\n   - If Isabella is a knave, then her statement must be false. This means Riley is not a knave, which implies Riley could be a knight but since he also claimed to be a knave, this scenario doesn't hold because it leads to a contradiction unless Isabella is actually a knight, making her claim invalid.\n\n3. **Riley's Statement**: \"Amelia is a knave and Isabella is a knave.\"\n   - If Riley is a knight, his statement must be true. This means both Amelia and Isabella are indeed knaves.\n   - If Riley is a knave, his statement must be false. This means at least one of Amelia or Isabella is not a knave, which implies they might be knights but cannot both be knights as stated in the previous scenarios.\n\nNow let's consider the possible combinations:\n\n- If Amelia is a knight, then Riley must be a knave (because Isabella is also a knight).\n  - This leaves Riley a knave and Isabella a knight. However, this contradicts Riley claiming Amelia is a knave, so this scenario is invalid.\n\n- If Amelia is a knave, then Riley must be a knave (because Isabella is also a knave).\n  - This satisfies all conditions:\n    - Amelia lies, saying Riley is a knight.\n    - Isabella tells the truth, stating Riley is a knave.\n    - Riley lies, saying Amelia is a knave and Isabella is a knave.\n\nSo, the valid configuration is:\n- Amelia is a knave,\n- Isabella is",

However, since we don't know whether Ethan is a knight or a knave yet, let's consider both possibilities.\n\n2. **Mason says, \"Ethan is a knave.\"**\n   - If Ethan were a knave (liar), his statement would be true, which contradicts the fact that he said it was false. Therefore, Ethan cannot be a knave. Hence, Ethan must be a knight (truth-teller).\n\n3. **Luke claims, \"Ethan is a knight and Ethan is a knave.\"**\n   - Since we've established that Ethan is indeed a knight (truth-teller), his claim about himself being a knave must be false. Thus, Luke cannot be a knight either because knights always tell the truth. Now we need to determine what Luke could possibly be based on his own statement.\n\n4. **Considering the implications of Luke\u2019s statement:**\n   - If Luke were a knight, he would be telling the truth, but this contradicts the previous conclusion that Ethan is a knight. So, Luke cannot be a knight.\n   - If Luke were a knave, he would be lying, so his statement \"Ethan is a knight and Ethan is a knave\" would also be false. This aligns with our earlier deduction that Ethan is a knight and Luke cannot be a knave (which we already concluded).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Ethan is a knight, he is telling the truth when he says that if he were a knight, then Luke would be a knave.

Therefore, Riley must be a knight.\n\nThis leads to a contradiction because we assumed Riley is a knight but then concluded Elizabeth must be a knave, making Riley a liar. Hence, Riley cannot be a knight.\n\n### Scenario 2: Assume Riley is a knave (liar)\n- If Riley is a knave, then Riley's statement can't be true.\n- Riley's statement claims \"Elizabeth is a knave if and only if Elizabeth is a knight.\" Since Riley is lying, we know at least one part of his statement must be false.\n- Let's examine the conditions under which Riley\u2019s statement could be false:\n  - If Elizabeth is a knave, then Riley's second condition is false (\"if Elizabeth is a knave\"), which is consistent with him being a liar.\n  - However, Riley's first condition is that \"Elizabeth is a knave\" is true, which is contradictory to his claim that it's false.

However, if David were a liar, his statement would also be false because it cannot have two parts that both contradict each other.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nLet's analyze the statements made by Jacob, Aurora, and Logan step-by-step.\n\n1. **Jacob's Statement**: \"Logan is a knight and Aurora is a knave.\"\n   - If Jacob is telling the truth, then both Logan and Aurora must be knights and knaves respectively.\n   - If Jacob is lying, then either Logan or Aurora (or both) would be a knave instead of a knight.\n\n2. **Aurora's Statement**: \"Logan is a knight if and only if Jacob is a knave.\"\n   - This statement implies two possible scenarios:\n     - Scenario A: Logan is a knight, and Jacob is a knave.\n     - Scenario B: Both Logan and Jacob are knights.\n   \n3. **Logan's Statement**: \"Jacob is a knight if and only if Jacob is a knave.\"\n   - This means that if Jacob is telling the truth, he must also be lying about his own identity being true or false.\n   - Therefore, if Jacob is telling the truth, he cannot be a knight because knights always tell the truth; similarly, if Jacob is telling the truth, he cannot be a knave because knaves always lie.\n\nNow let's combine these insights:\n\n- If Jacob were a knight, then both Aurora and Logan would be knaves according to Jacob\u2019s first statement. However, Aurora says that Logan is a knight, which contradicts the fact that Aurora is a knave. Thus, Jacob cannot be a knight.\n  \n- If Jacob were a knave, then his first statement \u201cLogan is a knight and Aurora is a knave\u201d would be a lie. Since Jacob is a liar, his statement can indeed have both parts as false (logically possible for a knave).\n\n- From Aurora's second statement, if Logan is a knight, then Jacob must be a knave. But we already established that if Jacob were a knave, his first statement would contradict itself. Hence, this scenario is impossible.\n\n- Therefore, considering all possibilities, the only consistent scenario where none of the contradictions arise is when both Logan and Jacob are knights.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth Jacob and Logan are knights, while Aurora is a knave. \n\n**FINAL RESULT:** YES, KNIGHT,LAWRENCE,KNAVE,AURORA,KNIFE.",

But if Samuel were a knave (liar), his statement would be false.\n\n2. **Samuel's Statement**: \"Benjamin is a knave and Penelope is a knave.\"\n   - This is a direct statement about Benjamin and Penelope being knaves.\n\n3. **Benjamin's Statement**: \"If Samuel is a knave then Penelope is a knight.\"\n   - This means that if Samuel were a knave (lying), Penelope must be a knight (telling the truth).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### Case 1: Assume Samuel is a Knight\n- According to Penelope's statement, if Samuel is a knight, his statement must be true, which leads us to a contradiction because Samuel cannot both be a knight and say he is a knave simultaneously.\n- Therefore, Samuel cannot be a knight.\n\n#### Case 2: Assume Samuel is a Knave\n- According to Samuel's statement, if Benjamin is a knave, then Penelope must also be a knave. However, we don't have enough information here yet.\n- Let\u2019s consider the possibility of Samuel as a knave and see what implications it has on other statements.\n\n#### Considering Samuel is a Knave:\n- Since Samuel is a liar, his statement \u201cBenjamin is a knave and Penelope is a knave\u201d must be false.\n- Thus, either Benjamin or Penelope must not be a knave.\n\n##### Sub-case 2.1: Assume Benjamin is a Knight\n- According to Samuel's statement, Benjamin being a knave makes Penelope a knave too.\n- Now, let's check Penelope's statement again: \"If Samuel is a knave then Samuel is a knave.\" Here, since Samuel is known to be a knave, Penelope's statement becomes trivially true.\n- We now have three possibilities for each inhabitant:\n  - Penelope: Knave\n  - Samuel: Knave\n  - Benjamin: Knight\n\nSo far, we have two possible configurations:\n1. **Penelope is a knave**, **Samuel is a knave**, **Benjamin is a knight**.\n2. **Penelope is a knight**, **Samuel is a knave**, **Benjamin",

This means if Lily were a knight, Amelia would not be a knight.\n\n3. **Statement by Amelia:** \"James is a knave.\"\n   - If Amelia is a knight, her statement must be true. This means James is a knave.\n   - If Amelia is a knave, her statement must be false. This means James is not a knave (i.e., he is a knight).\n\nNow let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n### Scenario 1: James is a knight\n- Since James is a knight, his statement \"Amelia is a knave or Lily is a knave\" must be true. This gives us two possibilities:\n  - Either Amelia is a knave, or Lily is a knave.\n  - However, we need to check if these imply that Amelia is indeed a knave when Lily is a knight and vice versa for Lily being a knave.\n\n#### Sub-case 1a: Amelia is a knave\n- If Amelia is a knave, her statement \"James is a knight\" must be false.

This means Lily is not a knight (contradicts our assumption), so this case is invalid.\n\nSince none of the sub-cases work under the condition that James is a knight, James must be a knave.\n\n### Conclusion: James is a knave\n\nThus, Lily and Amelia must be knights because they do not contradict each other in their statements when James is known to be a",

This means Abigail is not a knight, which is consistent with our conclusion from Scarlett.\n- If Abigail were a knave (liar), then her statement would be false because it claims something contradictory to herself being a knight.

This means both parts of the statement (Samuel is a knave AND Samuel is a knight) must be true simultaneously.

A false statement does not affect the truth value of other statements.\n   - Alexander's statement remains valid regardless of Owen's status as a knight or knave. The truthfulness of Alexander's statement depends solely on what he actually says, which is \"If Owen is a knight then Samuel is a knave.\"\n\n3. **Samuel's statement**: \"Alexander is a knave and Alexander is a knight.\"\n   - We need to check if Alexander can be both a knave and a knight based on Samuel's statement.

Therefore, we need to consider the logical structure of the statement. It implies that if Jacob were a knave, then Oliver would have to be a knave as well, and vice versa. Given the nature of knights and knaves, it\u2019s logically consistent for both to be either true or false independently, but together they contradict themselves due to mutual exclusivity.

It states that if Olivia is telling the truth (which means she is a knight), then Logan must be lying (which means he is a knave).\n   - Therefore, Olivia cannot be a knight; she must be a knave because she lied about Logan being a knave.\n\nSo, we have concluded:\n- **Abigail** is a knave.\n- **Logan** is a knave.\n- **Olivia** is a knave.\n\nSince all three inhabitants are knaves, there is no valid combination of truth-tellers among them. Therefore, there is no solution where exactly two people are knights and one is a knave.\n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO/\nRESULT: final_value\n```",

This would mean Henry is a knight (since knaves always lie).\n\n2. **Avery says: \"Henry is a knave and Avery is a knight.\"**\n   - Since we already determined that Henry is either a knight or a knave based on William's statement, let\u2019s consider both cases for Avery.\n\n**Case 1: Henry is a knight.**\n\n- From Avery's statement, since Henry is a knight, it follows that Avery cannot be a knight (because knights always tell the truth). Therefore, Avery must be a knave.\n\n**Case 2: Henry is a knave.**\n\n- From Avery's statement, since Henry is a knave, Avery could either be a knight or a knave. However, if Avery were a knight, then Avery's statement would contradict itself because a knight never lies. Thus, Avery must be a knave.\n\nIn both scenarios, we have concluded:\n\n- If Henry is a knight, then William must also be a knight (since William tells the truth about Henry being a non-knight).\n- If Henry is a knave, then William must be a knave (since William lies about Henry being a non-knight).\n\nGiven these conclusions, we can determine the following:\n\n- If Henry is a knight, then William is a knight, Avery is a knave.\n- If Henry is a knave, then William is a knave, Avery is a knave.\n\nSince one of them must be a knight and the other a knave, we need to choose which scenario fits our initial conditions better. \n\nBy examining Avery's statement again carefully:\n- If Henry is a knight, Avery cannot be a knight.\n- If Henry is a knave, Avery could be either a knight or a knave, but as per Avery's statement, it logically suggests Avery must be a knave (to avoid contradiction with Henry being a knave).\n\nTherefore, the correct scenario is when Henry is a knight, and Avery is a knave.\n\nThus, the final result is:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nRESULT: William,knave,Avery,knave\n```",

Since Daniel cannot be a knight as per the third assumption, we have a contradiction here because \"Daniel is a knight\" part of the statement can't be true if Daniel isn\u2019t a knight. Thus, Luke cannot be a knight.\n\n2. **Assume Luke is a Knave**:\n   - If Luke is a knave, his statement \"Luke is a knight or Daniel is a knight\" must be false. This means both parts of his statement must be false simultaneously.\n     - The first part (\"Luke is a knight\") is false.\n     - The second part (\"Daniel is a knight\") is also false because if Daniel was a knight, Luke would be telling the truth.\n   \n   Consequently, if Luke is a knave, it follows that Daniel must be a knave as well since his statement \"Sophia is not a knave\" is consistent under this scenario. This makes Luke and Daniel knaves.\n\nNow, considering Sophia\u2019s statement",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nsystem\nTo solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement step-by-step.\n\n1. **Ava's Statement:** \"Ava is a knight if and only if Noah is a knight.\"\n   - This can be broken down into two parts: \"If Ava is a knight, then Noah must also be a knight\" and \"If Noah is a knight, then Ava must also be a knight.\"\n\n2. **Charlotte's Statement:** \"Noah is a knight or Ava is a knave.\"\n   - This means either Noah is a knight or Ava is a knave (or both).\n\n3. **Noah's Statement:** \"Ava is a knave if and only if Charlotte is a knave.\"\n   - This can be broken down into two parts: \"If Ava is a knave, then Charlotte must also be a knave\" and \"If Charlotte is a knave, then Ava must also be a knave.\"\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n- Assume Ava is a knight. Then Noah must also be a knight because of Ava's first part. According to Noah's second part, if Ava is a knight, then Charlotte cannot be a knave (since they say it is false). However, Charlotte's statement would contradict this since she says that if Noah is a knight, then Ava is a knave, which is not true given Ava being a knight. Therefore, Ava cannot be a knight.\n\n- If Ava is a knave, then according to Noah's first part, Noah must also be a knave (since he lies about his own identity). Now, according to Noah's second part, if Ava is a knave, then Charlotte must be a knave as well (because she lies about her own identity and states it is false). Charlotte's statement aligns with this scenario, stating that if Noah is a knave, then Ava is a knave. Hence, both Noah and Charlotte could be knaves under these conditions.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO/YES\nRESULT: Noah,knave, Charlotte,knave,Ava,knight\n```",

Thus, Joseph must be a knight as well.\n   \n**Case 2: Joseph is a Knave:**\n   - If Joseph is a knave, his statement \"If and only if Isabella is a knight, then Joseph is a knight\" must be false.\n     - This statement says that if Isabella is a knight, Joseph would be a knight, but it is false since Joseph is actually a knave.\n     - We need to find a contradiction here because Joseph being a knave contradicts his own statement about Isabella.\n     \nHowever, there seems to be no clear contradiction within these logical deductions when considering each person individually. Given our initial assumption, let\u2019s re-evaluate:\n\n**Revised Conclusion Based on Initial Assumption:**\nGiven that Isabella's assertion leads us to assume Joseph could potentially be a knight without immediate conflict, we reconsider Joseph's identity under different scenarios where other factors might affect Joseph's status.\n\nSince Isabella asserts Joseph isn't a knave, we explore further possibilities:\n\n**Final Logical Deduction:**\n-",

This would make Isabella's statement false because it claims that \"Jack is a knave and Olivia is a knave.\" However, if Isabella were to be a knight, her statement would also have to be true, which contradicts our assumption that she could be a knight or a knave simultaneously based on her own claim.\n   \n2. **Olivia's Statement**: \"Jack is a knight.\"\n   - If Olivia is a knight (and tells the truth), then her statement must be true, meaning \"Jack is a knight.\"\n\nFrom Olivia's statement, we can deduce:\n- If Olivia is a knight, then Jack must be a knight as well.\n\nNow let's consider Isabella's statement again under the condition that Jack is a knight:\n- If Jack is a knight, his statement \"Jack is a knave and Olivia is a knave\" would be false because he is not a knave.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nLet's analyze the statements one by one.\n\n1. **Joseph**: \"Benjamin is a knight.\"\n2. **Henry**: \"If Benjamin is a knight then Joseph is a knight.\"\n3. **Benjamin**: \"Henry is not a knave.\"\n\nFirstly, let's consider the possibility that any of these individuals could be a knight or a knave:\n\n- If Joseph were a knight, his statement would be true, meaning Benjamin must be a knight.\n- If Joseph were a knave, his statement would be false, meaning Benjamin cannot be a knight (since he lies).\n\nNow, let's look at Henry's statement. It states that if Benjamin is a knight, then Joseph is also a knight. This means that if we assume Benjamin is a knight (from Joseph\u2019s statement), then Joseph must also be a knight.\n\nGiven that Joseph is assumed to be a knight, let's check if this leads us to a consistent solution for Benjamin and Henry.\n\n1. **Assume Joseph is a knight**:\n   - Since Joseph is a knight, his statement \"Benjamin is a knight\" is true.\n   - Therefore, Benjamin must be a knight.\n\n   Now, Henry's statement \"If Benjamin is a knight then Joseph is a knight\" holds because both Benjamin and Joseph are now confirmed as knights.\n\nSo, based on our assumption, all three people\u2014Joseph, Henry, and Benjamin\u2014are knights.\n\nThe final result is:\n```\nYES, YES, YES\n```",

This can be written as:\n\\[ \\text{B} \\implies \\text{J} \\]\n\nHowever, we know that Benjamin is either a knight or a knave, but not both at the same time due to the rule of knights and knaves. If B = K, it contradicts the fact that Benjamin cannot be both a knight and a knave simultaneously. Therefore, if B = K, J must be false because if J were true, it would imply that Benjamin is a knight, which is contradictory since Benjamin is a knave. Thus, Jack\u2019s statement is a paradoxical situation where he makes an assertion about his own status based on an impossible scenario.\n\n#### Benjamin's Statement\nBenjamin states that if Jack is a knave (J = K), then Jack must be a knight (K). This can be written as:\n\\[ \\neg J \\implies \\neg J \\]\n\nThis is trivially true because any statement implying its negation is logically invalid. However, this doesn't provide us direct information about Benjamin's identity.\n\n#### Amelia's Statement\nAmelia asserts that if Benjamin is a knave (B = K), then Amelia must be a knight (K). This can be written as:\n\\[ B \\implies \\text{K} \\]\n\nGiven that Benjamin is either a knight or a knave, if B = K, then Amelia must indeed be a knight for the implication to hold. But if B = K, then Jack's statement becomes problematic as explained earlier.\n\nNow let's consider possible scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1: Benjamin is a Knight**\n- If B = K, then according to Amelia's statement \\( B \\implies \\text{K} \\) holds, so Amelia is a knight.\n- Benjamin being a knight contradicts Jack's statement because if Benjamin is a knight, Jack's statement \\( B \\implies \\text{J} \\) would",

However, if Logan were a knave, he would contradict his own statement, which says \"Lily is a knight if and only if Logan is a knight.\" Therefore, Abigail cannot be a knight because it leads to a contradiction.\n\nSo, let's consider the case where Abigail is a knave (K).\n\nIf Abigail is a knave (K):\n- According to Abigail\u2019s statement, if Logan is a knave (Knave), then Abigail must be a knight (K). But if Abigail is a knave, she cannot be a knight, so this condition cannot hold true for Logan being a knave.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the most consistent scenario is that Abigail is indeed a knave (K). Now let's check the implications:\n\n- Since Abigail is a knave (K), her statement about Logan being a knave or knight does not provide new information that contradicts itself directly.\n  \n- **Lily** claims \"Abigail is a knave,\" but since we established Abigail as a knave, this part of Lily's statement is incorrect.\n\n- Finally, Logan says \"Lily is a knight if and only if Logan is a knight.\" Given our conclusion that Abigail is a knave, Lily cannot be a knight, making Logan's statement false because there is no condition under which Logan could be a knight based on Lily being a knave.\n\nTherefore, we conclude",

This means David is a knave (since he lies) and Alexander is a knight (since he tells the truth).\n   - However, if Alexander is a knight, his statement \"If Isabella is a knight then David is a knight\" would also be true because an honest person will not make false claims about other people.

This means either William is a knave or Oliver is a knave.\n  \n  - **Case 1a**: William is a knave.\n    - In this case, Oliver could also be a knave because it does not contradict the original statement.\n    \n  - **Case 1b**: Oliver is a knave.\n    - If Oliver is a knave, his statement \"If Michael is a knave, then William is a knave\" would be false because Michael is a knight.

Therefore, Jack is not a knight.\n\n**Now, consider Samuel's statement (S -> K -> N):**\n- If Samuel is a knight (K), then both parts of the implication must hold true.\n  - \\( S \\rightarrow K \\) means if Samuel is a knight, then Jack is a knight (\\( J \\)).\n  - \\( K \\rightarrow N \\) means if Jack is a knight, then Lily is a knave (\\( L \\)).\n\nHowever, since we already know that Jack is not a knight from our previous analysis, the implication \\( S \\rightarrow K \\) is vacuously true regardless of whether Samuel is a knight or not. But for Samuel's statement to be consistent, \\( S \\) itself must be true.\n\nSo, Samuel could either be a knight or a knave. Let's explore both possibilities:\n\n#### Case 1: Samuel is a knight (K):\n- If Samuel is a knight, then \\( S \\) is true.\n- From \\( S \\rightarrow K \\), since \\( S \\) is true, \\( K \\) must be true.\n- From \\( K \\rightarrow N \\), since \\( K \\) is true, \\( N \\) must be true.\n- Therefore, Samuel is a knight, Jack is a knight, and Lily is a knave.\n\n#### Case 2",

Therefore:\n  - The first part of Oliver's statement: \"If Oliver is a knight then Daniel is a knave\" must be true.\n    - Since Oliver is a knight, he tells the truth, so if Oliver is a knight, Daniel must be a knave.\n  \n  Now we have:\n  - \\( O = K \\)\n  - \\( D = N \\)\n\n- Check Daniel's statement: \"If Ava is a knight then Ava is a knave\".\n  - Ava could either be a knight or a knave.\n  - If Ava is a knight (which is consistent since she cannot be both), her statement would be false because she claims it's true.\n  - If Ava is a knave, her statement would also be false, but the contradiction arises from the fact that a knave lies about what they know to be false.\n\nThus, assuming Oliver is a knight leads to a contradiction where Daniel\u2019s and Ava\u2019s statements become false simultaneously.\n\n#### Case 2: Assume Oliver is a knave (\\( O = N \\))\n\n- If Oliver is a knave, his statement becomes false. Therefore:\n  - The first part of Oliver's statement: \"If Oliver is a knight then Daniel is a knave\" must be false.\n    - Since Oliver is a knave, he lies about his statement, which means \u201cIf Oliver is a knight\u201d is actually false.\n    - Thus, the second part of Oliver's statement: \"Daniel is a knave\" must also be false.\n    \n  This implies:\n  - \\( D = K \\)\n\nNow we have:\n- \\( O = N \\)\n- \\( D = K \\)\n\n- Check Daniel's statement: \"If Ava is a knight then Ava is a knave\".\n  - Given \\( O = N \\) and \\( D = K \\), Ava can",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nTo solve this problem, let's analyze the statements made by each inhabitant:\n\n1. **Sebastian** said, \"Sebastian is a knight if and only if Ethan is a knave.\" This statement can be broken down into two parts:\n   - If Sebastian is a knight (truth-teller), then Ethan must be a knave (liar).\n   - If Sebastian is a knave (liar), then Ethan must be a knight (truth-teller).\n\n2. **Ethan** said, \"Sebastian is a knight if and only if Ethan is a knight.\"\n\n3. **Scarlett** stated, \"Ethan is not a knight.\"\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios for each person being either a knight or a knave.\n\n### Scenario Analysis\n\n#### Case 1: Sebastian is a Knight\n- If Sebastian is a knight, then his statement \"Sebastian is a knight if and only if Ethan is a knave\" is true. Therefore, if Sebastian is a knight, then Ethan must be a knave.\n- Since Ethan is a knave, he would also say that Sebastian is a knight, which contradicts our assumption that Sebastian is a knight because a knight cannot lie about what another knight says. Thus, this scenario is impossible.\n\n#### Case 2: Sebastian is a Knave\n- If Sebastian is a knave, then his statement \"Sebastian is a knight if and only if Ethan is a knave\" is false. Therefore, at least one of the following must be true:\n  - Sebastian is a knight (contradiction since we assumed Sebastian is a knave).\n  - Ethan is a knight.\n  \n  However, if Ethan is a knight, then his statement \"Sebastian is a knight if and only if Ethan is a knight\" is false. But since Sebastian is a knave, this means that if Sebastian were to be a knight, Ethan would have to be a knave. This creates a contradiction because it implies that both conditions cannot be simultaneously true when Sebastian is lying.\n\nGiven these contradictions, neither Sebastian nor Ethan can be a knight based on their statements alone. The only remaining possibility is that Scarlett is correct.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince Scarlett's statement \"Ethan is not a knight\" holds true, Ethan must indeed be a knave. Now, considering Sebastian\u2019s original statement again:\n- Since Ethan is a knave, his statement \"Sebastian is a knight if and only if Ethan is a knave\" is false.\n-",

Therefore, \\( \\neg K \\) implies \\( K = \\text{false} \\). This means Ethan is a knave.\n\nSince Ethan is a knave, his statement \"Aurora is a knave or Aurora is a knight\" must be false.

He is not a knight nor a knave.\n\n3. **Analysis of Elizabeth's statement:**\n   - Elizabeth says, \"Elizabeth is a knight or Aiden is a knave.\"\n   - If Elizabeth were a knight, her statement would be true because it would mean either she is a knight or Aiden is a knave (since knights always tell the truth).\n   - However, if Elizabeth were a knave, her statement would be false because it would imply that she is a knight, which contradicts the fact that she is a knave.\n   - Given that Elizabeth cannot be a knight (because if she were, her statement would be true), the only possibility left is that she is a knave.\n\n4. **Analysis of Mason's statement:**\n   - Mason says, \"If Elizabeth is a knave then Aiden is a knave.\"\n   - Since we have established that Elizabeth is a knave, we can substitute \"knave\" into Mason's statement.\n   - The statement becomes: \"If knave is a knave then Aiden is a knave,\" which simplifies to \"False -> False.\" Any conditional statement where the hypothesis is false will be considered as true regardless of the conclusion.\n   - This confirms that Mason's statement is consistent with the information provided.\n\n5. **Final Analysis:**\n   - We know that Aiden is a liar, Elizabeth is a knave, and Mason's statement holds true.\n   - Therefore, Aiden is a knave, Elizabeth is a knave, and Mason is a knight.\n\n**SOLUTION:**",

This directly contradicts our assumption that Emily is a knight. Therefore, Emily cannot be a knight.

The only way for Samuel to make a consistent statement is if he is a knight. If Samuel is a knight, then the second part of the statement must be false, meaning the first part (that Lily is a knave) must be true.

His statement says \"Lily is a knave if and only if Emily is a knight.\" This means that if Emily is a knight, then Lily must be a knave, but since Emily is a knight, Lily must actually be a knight (which we assumed initially). This makes Samuel's statement contradictory unless we consider the possibility that his statement could be interpreted differently within the framework of his being a knave.\n\nRevisiting the logical consistency:\n- If Samuel is a knave, his statement must be analyzed as follows:\n  - The statement says \"Lily is a knave if and only if Emily is a knight\" is false.\n  - If Emily is a knight, then Lily must be a knave (contradiction).\n  - Thus, if Samuel is",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nTo solve this problem, let's analyze the statements made by each inhabitant step by step.\n\n1. **Chloe says**: \"Victoria is a knight if and only if Emma is a knave.\"\n2. **Victoria says**: \"Emma is a knave if and only if Victoria is a knight.\"\n3. **Emma says**: \"Chloe is a knight or Victoria is a knight.\"\n\nWe need to determine who is a knight (truth-teller) and who is a knave (liar).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### Assume Chloe is a knight:\nIf Chloe is a knight, her statement \"Victoria is a knight if and only if Emma is a knave\" must be true.\n- If Victoria is a knight, then Emma must also be a knave for the condition to hold.\n- However, if Emma is a knave, she would contradict herself because she said \"Emma is a knave if and only if Victoria is a knight.\" Since Emma cannot both be a knave and say \"Emma is a knave,\" this scenario is impossible unless we consider other possibilities.\n\n#### Assume Chloe is a knave:\nIf Chloe is a knave, her statement is false. This means there exists at least one case where the implication does not hold.\n- Let's try different combinations:\n  - If Victoria is a knight, then Emma must be a knave for the implication to fail. But if Emma is a knave, she lies about it being true when actually false. So this works as long as Emma remains a knave.\n  - If Emma is a knight, then Victoria must be a knave for the implication to fail. But if Victoria is a knave, she lies about it being true when actually false. This also works since Emma can remain a knight.\n\nHowever, if Victoria were to change roles such that she becomes a knave while Emma remains a knight, then Emma would still satisfy the condition of lying about her own truthfulness, making Emma still a knave.\n\nTherefore, either way, Emma will always end up as a knave and Victoria will alternate between knight and knave depending on their roles.\n\n### Conclusion:\nFrom our analysis, we conclude that Emma is a knave, and Victoria alternates between being a knight and a knave based on whether they are telling the truth.\n\n**Final Result:** \n```\nEmma is a knave, Victoria is a knave, Michael is a knight\n```",

Therefore, Amelia cannot be a knight.\n- Since Amelia is not a knight, her statement about Luke being a knight or a knave doesn't hold true anymore.\n\n- From Luke's statement, he is claiming two things:\n  - He is a knight.\n  - Harper is a knave.\n  \n  But if Luke were a knight, his second part (\"Harper is a knave\") would be false.

If Aurora is a knight, then Avery must be a knave (because if Aurora were telling the truth, she would be a knight, which contradicts her own statement). However, since we assumed Aurora is a knight for now, Avery cannot be a knight. Therefore, Avery must be a knave.\n\n3. **Avery's Statement**: \"If Avery is a knight then Riley is a knave.\"\n   - Since we have established that Avery is a knave, this statement becomes irrelevant because it requires Avery to be a knight, but he is not.\n\nFrom the analysis above:\n- If Riley is a knight, then Aurora is a knight, and Avery is a knave.\n- If Riley is a knave, then Aurora is a knave, and Avery is a knight.\n\nSince Riley asserts that Aurora is a knight, and we've already concluded that if Riley is a knight, Aurora must also be a knight, we can conclude that Riley is a knight.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Riley is a knight, Aurora is a knight, Avery is a knave\n```",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nLet's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Logan's statement**: \"Liam is not a knave.\"\n   - If Logan is a knight (and thus telling the truth), then Liam must indeed not be a knave.\n   - If Logan is a knave (and thus lying), then Liam must be a knave.\n\n2. **Liam's statement**: \"Logan is a knave or Jackson is a knight.\"\n   - This can be broken down into two possible scenarios:\n     a) Logan is a knave and Jackson is a knight.\n     b) Logan is a knave and Jackson is also a knave.\n   \n3. **Jackson's statement**: \"Logan is a knight and Jackson is a knight.\"\n   - This directly states that both Logan and Jackson are knights.\n\nNow let's consider each possibility for Jackson based on what we know:\n\n- If Jackson is a knight, his statement aligns perfectly with reality. However, if Jackson were a knight, then both Logan and Jackson would need to be knights because he explicitly said so himself.\n  \nGiven these analyses:\n\n- If Jackson is a knight, then according to Jackson\u2019s statement, Logan must be a knight as well, which contradicts our earlier analysis where Logan could potentially be either a knight or a knave depending on whether he told the truth or lied.\n  \nTherefore, the only consistent scenario under these constraints is:\n- Logan is a knave.\n- Liam is a knight.\n- Jackson is a knight.\n\n**Final Result:**\n```\nYES/Liam is a knight, Jackson is a knight\n```",

Therefore, David must indeed be a knight.\n\n**Statement by David**: \"Amelia is a knight\" and \"David is a knight.\"  \nSince we already concluded that Amelia is a knight (because Amelia claims so), this part of David's statement is redundant since it confirms Amelia is a knight. However, David's second part still holds because he lies if he is a knight. Thus, David is also a liar.\n\n**Statement by Ethan**: \"David is a knight.\"  \nThis statement contradicts David\u2019s claim that he is a knight (since David is lying). Therefore, Ethan cannot be a knight; otherwise, his own statement would be false, which aligns with what we've established about David being a liar.\n\nSo far, we have:\n- Amelia is a knight.\n- David is a liar.\n\nNow, let's check Ethan's statement again considering our findings:\n- If Ethan were a knight, his statement \"David is a knight\" would be true, but we know from our analysis that David is a liar. This contradiction means Ethan cannot be a knight.\n\nThus, Ethan must be a knave.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, Amelia is a knight and Ethan is a knave. David remains undetermined until more context or additional information is provided about him. Since both Amelia and Ethan can't be knights based on their individual statements, there isn't enough information to definitively conclude whether David is a knight or a knave without further details.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO/YES\nRESULT: final_value\n```",

Thus, if Lily is a knight, then Daniel must be a knave (because if Lily were a knave, Daniel would have to be a knight).\n- If Lily is a knave, it contradicts the assumption that Elizabeth is a knight because she cannot be lying about Lily being a knight if she herself is a knave.\n- Therefore, this case leads to a contradiction, so Elizabeth cannot be a knight.\n\n**Case 2:** Assume Elizabeth is a knave.\n- If Elizabeth is a knave, her statement must be false. Thus, if Lily is a knight, Daniel could be either a knight or a knave.\n- However, we know from Lily\u2019s statement that if Lily is a knight, then Daniel must be a knight. This means Daniel must indeed be a knight.\n- But if Daniel is a knight, his statement \"Lily is not a knight\" is false, which again contradicts our initial assumption that Elizabeth is a knave.\n\nSince assuming Elizabeth is a knight leads to a contradiction and assuming she is a knave also leads to contradictions, there seems to be an inconsistency in the problem as stated.\n\nHowever, given the logical constraints of knights and knaves, let's re-evaluate carefully:\n\n1.

But since we don't know Avery's status yet, let's consider both cases for Daniel's statement:\n\n    - **Case 1:** If Avery is a knave:\n      - Then Daniel\u2019s statement becomes \"If A (knave) is a knave then B (knave) is a knave\".\n      - Since an impossible situation like \u201ca knave being a knave\u201d cannot happen, this case leads to a contradiction. Therefore, Avery cannot be a knave.\n\n    - **Case 2:** If Avery is a knight:\n      - Then Daniel\u2019s statement becomes \"If A (knight) is a knave then B (knave) is a knave\".\n      - Since Avery is a knight, his statement would logically contradict itself because it implies that if Avery were a knight, then Abigail would have to be a knave. However, we need to check other conditions.\n\n2. **Abigail's Statement**: \"Avery is a knight and Daniel is a knave.\"\n   - We already determined from Daniel's analysis that Avery can't be a knave (because otherwise, his own statement about Daniel would be contradictory).\n\n3. **Avery's Statement**: \"Abigail is not a knave.\"\n   - This directly contradicts Abigail's previous assertion that she herself is a knight.\n\nNow, let's summarize what we've concluded so far:\n- Avery cannot be a knave based on Daniel's initial condition.\n- Abigail's first statement that Avery is a knight directly contradicts her second statement that Abigail is not a knave.\n\nGiven these contradictions, the logical conclusion is that none of them can consistently state their positions without causing self-contradictions. \n\nThus, **none** of them can be considered as either knights or knaves simultaneously consistent with all three statements provided. \n\nSo, the answer is:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nRESULT: NONE\n```",

However, if Zoey were a knave, Riley would also be lying because the implication does not require Zoey being a knave but just that she is neither a knight nor a knave (which means she is a liar).\n   - Therefore, Riley cannot make this statement consistently unless Zoey is a liar.\n\n2. **Grace's Statement**: \"Zoey is a knight or Riley is a knight.\"\n   - If Zoey is a knight, Grace tells the truth, so Riley must also be a knight. This contradicts Riley's statement that Zoey can't be a knight if she is a knave, which implies Riley must be a knave.\n   - If Zoey is a knave, Grace lies, meaning Riley is not a knight. Since Riley is a knave, Riley's statement that Zoey can't be a knave (because she is a liar) is false. This creates a contradiction because Riley would have to be a knight according to his own statement, making him tell the truth when he says Zoey is a knave.\n   - Therefore, Zoey must be a knight, and Riley must be a knave.

Jack said: \"Penelope is a knave or Penelope is a knight.\"\n   This statement can be broken down into two cases:\n   - Case 1: If Penelope is a knight (which means she tells the truth), then the statement is true because a knight would say either \"knave\" or \"knight\".\n   - Case 2: If Penelope is a knave (which means she lies), then the statement must be false.

This creates a contradiction because we assumed Logan is a Knave, so his second statement (\"Logan is a knight and Zoey is a knight\") would also be false according to him.\n\nThis scenario leads to a contradiction, so Benjamin cannot be a Knight.\n\n### Scenario 2: Assume Benjamin is a Knave\n- If Benjamin is a Knave, his statement must be false.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nLet's analyze the statements one by one:\n\n1. **Jack says:** \"Jack is a knight and Ethan is a knave.\"\n2. **Abigail says:** \"Jack is a knight.\"\n3. **Ethan says:** \"Abigail is a knave or Jack is a knight.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Case 1: Assume Jack is a knight.\n- If Jack is a knight, then his statement must be true.\n  - Jack claims he is a knight (\"Jack is a knight\").\n  - Jack also claims Ethan is a knave (\"Ethan is a knave\").\n\nHowever, if Jack is a knight, then both parts of his statement must be true:\n  - \"Jack is a knight\" (True)\n  - \"Ethan is a knave\" (False)\n\nSince it\u2019s impossible for both conditions to simultaneously hold true, Jack cannot be a knight.\n\n#### Case 2: Assume Jack is a knave.\n- If Jack is a knave, then his statement must be false.\n  - Jack claims he is a knight (\"Jack is a knight\"), which is false.\n  - Jack also claims Ethan is a knave (\"Ethan is a knave\"), which is false.\n\nSince Jack's statement about himself being a knight is false, his claim about Ethan being a knave must be true. Thus, Ethan must indeed be a knave.\n\n#### Conclusion\n- Jack is a knave because his first part of the statement was false.\n- Abigail says she knows Jack is a knight.\n  - This implies that Abigail must be a knight since knights always tell the truth.\n- Ethan says Abigail is a knave or Jack is a knight.\n  - Since we know Abigail is a knight and Jack is a knave, this means Jack is not a knight, making his claim about Abigail false.\n  - Therefore, Ethan must be a knave because he lies when he says Abigail is a knave.\n\nSo, the final assignment is:\n- Jack: Knave\n- Abigail: Knight\n- Ethan: Knave\n\n**Final Result:**\n```\nKnave, Knight, Knave\n```",

This means that if we assume Chloe is a knight, it follows that Sophia is also a knight. But if we assume Chloe is a knave (N), then Sophia cannot be a knight because knaves always lie. Therefore, we have two possibilities for Chloe being either K or N, but if Chloe were a knight, Sophia would necessarily be a knight, which contradicts the possibility of Chloe being a knave. Thus, Chloe cannot be a knight. Consequently, Chloe must be a knave (N).\n\n2. **Sophia's Statement**: \"If Chloe is a knight then Chloe is a knave.\"\n   - Since we have established that Chloe is a knave, any statement made about Chloe will be a lie from Sophia's perspective. However, since Sophia claims that if Chloe is a knight, then Chloe is a knave, this directly contradicts what we know about Chloe being a knave. Therefore, Sophia\u2019s claim implies that she is lying when she says this, meaning her statement is false under the assumption that Chloe is a knave. This further confirms that Chloe is indeed a knave.\n\n3. **Chloe's Statement**: \"Sophia is a knight and Alexander is a knave.\"\n   - If Chloe is a knave, then Chloe's statement must be a lie. The statement \"Sophia is a knight\" is true according to our previous analysis, so Chloe could not make this claim as a lie.

If David is a knave, then both conditions must be false simultaneously, meaning neither Aiden nor Abigail could be a knave.\n\n5. **Analyzing Abigail's Statement:**\n   - Abigail says, \"If David is a knight, then David is a knave, and vice versa.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement (a biconditional). If Aiden is a knight, then David cannot be a knight (as stated above); thus, Abigail's statement implies that David is indeed a knight when Aiden is a knight. However, since Aiden is not necessarily a knight, we need to consider the other possibilities.\n\n6. **Combining All Information:**\n   - From the analysis above, we see that if Aiden is a knight, then David must be a knave, and Abigail must also be a knave. But this leads to a contradiction because if Abigail is a knave, her statement would",

But if Chloe were a knight, she wouldn't make such an accurate statement about Oliver's identity.\n\nSo, if Samuel's statement is true (i.e., Oliver is not a knave), then Chloe must be a knight because Samuel's statement implies that Chloe is indeed a knight. This also means that Oliver cannot be a knave, which contradicts his first statement. Therefore, Samuel's statement must be false, meaning Oliver is a knave.\n\nNow we know Oliver is a knave. According to Oliver's statement, Chloe is a knight and Samuel is a knight. Since we already determined that Oliver is a knave, this part of Oliver's statement does not hold, but it doesn't contradict anything directly.\n\nFinally, Chloe makes her statement that states \"Oliver is a knave if and only if Samuel is a knight.\" Given our earlier conclusion that Oliver is a knave, this statement aligns perfectly since it correctly reflects the situation where both conditions (Oliver being a knave and Samuel being a knight) are satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n- **Oliver** is a knave,\n- **Samuel** is a knight,\n- **Chloe** is a knight.\n\nThe final result is: **knight,knight,knight**.",

This means if Riley were a knight (which would contradict her statement), Ella must be lying. Therefore, Riley cannot be a knight.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Luke's Statement\n\n- Luke states that if Ella is a knave, then Ella is a knight. Since we know from Ella's statement that Riley is not a knight, it follows that Ella must indeed be a knave because she contradicts herself if she were a knight.\n\nSo now we have:\n- Ella = Knave\n- Riley = Not a Knight (from Ella\u2019s statement)\n- Luke = Knave (because he lied about Ella being a knight)\n\n### Step 3: Verify Riley's Statement\n\n- Riley says, \"Ella is a knave or Luke is a knight.\"\n- We already established that Ella is a knave.

Thus, Benjamin must be a knight.\n- Since Benjamin is a knight, he will say the truth when asked about Joseph. Therefore, Joseph must also be a knight.\n\nIn this case:\n- Matthew is a knight.\n- Joseph is a knight.\n- Benjamin is a knight.\n\nThis scenario satisfies all the conditions given by both Matthew and Joseph.\n\n#### Case 2: Assume Matthew is a knave (and therefore lies).\n- If Matthew is a knave, his statement must be false. This means Benjamin cannot be a knight because if he were, Matthew would have told the truth.\n\nHowever, we already determined from Joseph's statement that if Benjamin were a knight, Joseph would be telling the truth. But since Matthew lied, Joseph could not be a knight. Therefore, Joseph must be a knave.\n\nGiven Joseph is a knave, his statement must be false. Hence, if Joseph is a knave, Benjamin cannot be a knight either because Joseph is lying. This creates a contradiction since we assumed Benjamin is a knight based on Matthew's first statement being true.\n\nThus, this scenario leads to an inconsistency where Matthew can't be a knave while maintaining consistency with the rest of the statements.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only consistent scenario is when Matthew is a knight, Joseph is a knight, and Benjamin is a knight. \n\n**Final Result:**\n```\nYES/NO, YES/NO, YES/NO\n```",

This means Jacob is indeed a knave, which contradicts Elizabeth being a knight.\n   - Therefore, Oliver cannot be a knight.\n\n2. **Elizabeth**: \"If Jacob is a knave then Jacob is a knight.\"\n   - This statement can be broken down into two cases:\n     - Case 1: Jacob is not a knave.\n       - If Jacob is not a knave, then the implication holds trivially as a false statement becomes true.\n     - Case 2: Jacob is a knave.\n       - If Jacob is a knave, the implication would be false because it states that if something is a knave, it must also be a knight, which is clearly incorrect.\n   - Since Oliver is not a knight, Elizabeth could still be a knight based on her second statement. Let's check if she fits with Jacob being a knave:\n     - If Jacob is a knave, then Elizabeth\u2019s statement \"If Jacob is a knave then Jacob is a knight\" is false because a knave denies the consequent when it is not the case that the antecedent is true.

Therefore, either Jackson is a knight or Lucas is a knave.\n- This means that if we assume Amelia is a knight, then either Jackson is a knight or Lucas is a knave.\n\nLet's consider both sub-cases for Amelia being a knight:\n\n##### Sub-case 1.1: Jackson is a Knight\n- If Jackson is a knight, his statement must also be true. Therefore, Lucas cannot be a knight (because he would contradict Amelia's statement).\n- In this scenario:\n  - Jackson is a knight.\n  - Lucas is a knave.\n  - Amelia is a knight.\n  \n##### Sub-case 1.2: Jackson is a Knave\n- If Jackson is a knave, his statement must be false. Therefore, Lucas could be either a knight or a knave.\n- However, since Jackson is a knave, his claim about Lucas is false. This implies that Lucas is indeed a knight because a knave would have lied about Lucas being a knight, which contradicts our assumption.\n\nFrom sub-case 1.1, we get:\n- Jackson is a knight,\n- Lucas is a knave,\n- Amelia is a knight.\n\nThis configuration does not work because it leads to a contradiction where Jackson\u2019s statement about Lucas being a knave is false when Jackson himself is a knave.\n\n#### Case 2: Assume Amelia is a Knave\n- If Amelia is a knave, then her statement must be false. Therefore, neither of the two parts of her statement can be true simultaneously.\n- Thus, Jackson must be a knave (since if he were a knight, his statement would be true).\n\n##### Sub-case 2.1: Jackson is a Knight\n- If Jackson is a knight, his statement must be true.

However, since Noah\u2019s statement about Logan being a knight is true, Chloe cannot both be a knight and a knave at the same time because no one can be both. Therefore, Noah's statement implies that Logan is not a knight. Hence, if Noah is claiming correctly, Logan is a knave.\n\n3. **Chloe stated that Noah is a knight if and only if Logan is a knight.**\n   - If Logan were a knight, Chloe's statement would mean Noah is also a knight. But we already concluded from Noah's truthful nature that he is a knave. Thus, Chloe's statement would contradict itself because it cannot simultaneously state that Noah is a knight when Logan is known to be a knave.\n\nGiven these contradictions, let's re-evaluate under the assumption that Noah might be mistaken and thus try another logical sequence:\n\n- Assume Noah\u2019s claim is false, meaning Logan could potentially be a knight (though we'll check further):\n  - If Logan is a knight, according to his statement, Chloe must be either a knight or a knave.\n  - Now consider Chloe\u2019s statement which says Noah is a knight if and only if Logan is a knight.

Therefore, Jacob must be a knave.\n\n- Benjamin states \"If Emily is a knight then Emily is a knave.\" Since Emily is a knight according to our assumption, the condition \"if p then q\" becomes \"if a then b,\" which means \"a\" must be true for the implication to hold.

However, since knights always tell the truth, Evelyn cannot be a liar when she says she is a knight. Therefore, Evelyn must be a knight.\n\n2. **Michael:** \"Evelyn is a knave or Evelyn is a knight.\"\n   - Since we already know that Evelyn is a knight, the statement simplifies to \"Evelyn is a knight,\" which is true. Thus, Michael could either be a knight or a knave.\n\n3. **William:** \"Evelyn is a knight if and only if Michael is a knave.\"\n   - This means that if Michael is a knave, Evelyn must also be a knave. But we established earlier that Evelyn is a knight regardless of what Michael says.\n\nFrom these deductions, it is clear that Michael must be a knight because his statement aligns with the fact that Evelyn is a knight. Therefore:\n\n**SOLUTION: YES**\n**RESULT: Michael is a knight, Evelyn is a knight**",

Therefore, Mason would be a knave according to Sofia.\n\n2. **Amelia's Statement**: Sofia is a knight if and only if Mason is a knave.

Since Mason is a knight, he is telling the truth about Sofia being a knight. However, since Sofia cannot be a knave based on Amelia\u2019s statement, she must be a knight as well. But this creates a contradiction because Mason can't be a knight if Sofia is a knight.\n\nGiven these contradictions, let's re-evaluate:\n\n- **Sofia's Truth**: If Sofia is a knight, then Mason must be a knave. But this contradicts Mason saying \"Mason is a knight.\"\n- **Amelia's Truth**: Both Sofia and Mason must be either both knights or both knaves.

Hence, Jacob must be a knight.\n\n3. **Emma's Claim**: \"Oliver is a knight and Jacob is a knave.\"\n   - Since we have established that Jacob is a knight, Emma's statement becomes \"Oliver is a knight.\"\n\nNow let's summarize our findings:\n\n- Jacob is a knight.\n- Emma's claim \"Oliver is a knight\" implies that Oliver is a knight as well.\n- The remaining person is Oliver, so Oliver must be a knight.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```\nYES\\ \nRESULT: Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knave, Ethan is a knight.\n```",

Let's consider two cases:\n\n**Case 1: Aurora is telling the truth.**\n- If Aurora is telling the truth, then \\( L \\rightarrow K \\) must be true.\n- Since Noah also believes Lucas is a knave (according to his own statement), he might not necessarily believe \\( L \\).

Since Ethan is a knave, this directly contradicts his own statement.\n\nThus, **Charlotte is a knave as well**.\n\nWe now have:\n- Sofia is a knave.\n- Ethan is a knave.\n- Charlotte is a knave.\n\nThis analysis shows there was an inconsistency since both Ethan and Charlotte\u2019s statements depend on Sofia being truthful which she isn\u2019t. \n\nGiven the initial contradictions found when assuming any of them could be a knight, it appears impossible to satisfy all statements simultaneously under normal logic. Hence, we conclude there might be an error in interpreting these statements or the problem setup itself may require reconsideration",
