Since Zoey is a knave, the only way for this to hold true is if Oliver is a knave as well.\n    - Conclusion: Both Zoey and Oliver are knaves.\n\n   **Case 2:** Zoey is a knave.\n    - If Zoey is a knave, her statement \u201cOliver is not a knight\u201d is false, implying Oliver is a knight.\n    - Oliver\u2019s statement \u201cOliver is a knight if and only if Zoey is a knave\u201d becomes \u201cOliver is a knight if and only if Zoey is a knave\u201d.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nassistant: Let's use deductive reasoning to solve this problem step by step:\n\n1) **Initial Observations**:\n   - Two people: Joseph and Harper\n   - One statement from each:  \n     - Joseph\u2019s Statement: \u201cJoseph is a knight if and only if Harper is a knave\u201d  \n     - Harper\u2019s Statement: \u201cIf Joseph is a knight then Harper is a knight\u201d\n\n2) **Analysis of Joseph\u2019s Statement**:\n   - If Joseph is a knight, his statement must be true, meaning that \u201cHarper is a knave\u201d\n   - If Joseph is a knave, his statement must be false, meaning that \u201cHarper is not a knave\u201d, which implies \u201cHarper is a knight\u201d\n\n3) **Analysis of Harper\u2019s Statement**:\n   - If Joseph is a knight, her statement must be true, meaning that \u201cHarper is a knight\u201d\n   - If Joseph is a knave, her statement must be false, meaning that \u201cHarper is not a knight\u201d, which implies \u201cHarper is a knave\u201d\n\n4) **Combining Both Statements**:\n   - We have two conflicting possibilities based on Joseph\u2019s initial claim:\n     1. Joseph is a knight, Harper is a knave\n     2. Joseph is a knave, Harper is a knight\n\n5) **Verifying Each Possibility**:\n   - Case 1: (Joseph is a knight, Harper is a knave)\n      - Joseph\u2019s Statement: \u201cKnight -> Knave\u201d \u2013 True, because if Joseph is a knight, then Harper must be a knave\n      - Harper\u2019s Statement: \u201cKnight -> Knight\u201d \u2013 False, because if Joseph is a knight, then Harper must be a knave\n   - Case 2: (Joseph is a knave, Harper is a knight)\n      - Joseph\u2019s Statement: \u201cKnave -> Knight\u201d \u2013 False, because if Joseph is a knave, then Harper must be a knight\n      - Harper\u2019s Statement: \u201cKnave -> Knight\u201d \u2013 True, because if Joseph is a knave, then Harper must be a knight\n\n6) **Conclusion**:\n   - Only one consistent pair can exist, so these cannot both be true simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, Joseph is a KNIGHT, and Harper is a KNAVE. \n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nRESULT: Joseph,Harper\n```",

Let\u2019s analyze these step by step:\n\n1) **Initial Analysis**:\n   - Each person can either be a Knight (who always tells the truth), or a Knave (who always lies).\n\n2) **Implications of Avery's Statement**:\n   - If Avery is a Knight, then his statement \u201cAvery is a knight and Henry is a knave\u201d must be true. This implies that Avery is indeed a knight, which contradicts our assumption that he is a Knight based on the next statement.\n   - Therefore, Avery cannot be a Knight.\n\n3) **Implications of Henry's Statement**:\n   - Since Avery is not a Knight, Henry\u2019s statement \u201cAvery is a knight\u201d must be false. This means Avery is actually a Knave.\n\n4) **Concluding Analysis**:\n   - Since we\u2019ve established that Avery is a Knave, his initial statement \u201cAvery is a knight and Henry is a knave\u201d is false. This aligns with our previous conclusion that Avery is a Knave.\n   - Given that both individuals are now identified as Knaves, their mutual statement about each other being Knights is inherently contradictory since they are both lying.\n\n### Final Result\n```\nNo\n```",

This implies that Lily is not a Knave, making her a Knight.\n\n3) **Contradiction Check**:\n   - Both scenarios lead to different conclusions about Lily\u2019s identity, indicating an inconsistency unless one of them is telling the truth while the other is lying.\n\n4) **Exploring Possible Scenarios**:\n   - **Scenario 1**: Assume Aiden is a Knight\n     - If Aiden is a Knight, his statement \u201cLily is a knave\u201d must be true.\n     - This means Lily is a Knave.\n     - Now, according to Lily\u2019s statement \u201cAiden is a knight and Aiden is a knave\u201d, we have:\n       - Aiden = True\n       - Aiden = False\n     - These statements contradict each other; hence, this scenario leads to no consistent solution.\n\n   - **Scenario 2**: Assume Aiden is a Knave\n     - If Aiden is a Knave, his statement \u201cLily is a knave\u201d must be false.\n     - This means Lily is a Knight.\n     - Now, according to Lily\u2019s statement \u201cAiden is a knight and Aiden is a knave\u201d, we have:\n       - Aiden = False\n       - Aiden = False\n     - These statements are consistent; thus, this scenario provides a valid solution where Aiden is a Knave and Lily is a Knight.\n\n5) **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on our analysis, Scenario 2 results in a coherent set of identities, implying Aiden is a Knave and Lily is a Knight.\n\n6) **Final Result**:\n   ```\n   No,Aiden is a Knave,Lily is a Knight\n   ```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nNo,Aiden is a Knave,Lily is a Knight\n```",

Then, Emily\u2019s statement \u201cIf Emily is a knight, then James is a knight\u201d becomes false, indicating that if Emily were a knight, James would also have to be a knight, which again conflicts with James being a knave.

From Alexander\u2019s remark: O & K\n\nCombining these, we get:\n- **If K = T**, then N = F, but **O & K** must hold.\n\nSince **K = T** implies **N = F**, and **O & K** must hold, **K** must indeed be True for **O & K** to be true.\n\nTherefore, **K = T** and **N = F**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on our logical deductions, Owen is a knight, and Alexander is a knave. \n\nSo, the final result is: **[\"Owen is a knight\", \"Alexander is a knave\"]**.",

In such a scenario, all their claims would be true, but since Jacob says Aurora is a knave, we reach a contradiction because if Jacob were a knight, then Aurora must indeed be a knave. \n\n**Step 2:** Now let\u2019s assume for contradiction that both Jacob and Aurora are knaves. In such a scenario, all their claims would be false, which means:\n- Jacob\u2019s claim \u201cAurora is a knave\u201d must be false, implying Aurora is not a knave (so, Aurora could be a knight).\n- Aurora\u2019s claim \u201cEither she is a knight or Jacob is a knight\u201d must be false, so neither she nor Jacob can be a knight. This implies that both must be knaves, leading to another contradiction since they cannot both be knaves if one is a knave.\n\nSince our initial assumption led to contradictions, we conclude that at least one of them is telling the truth and the other is lying.\n\n**Step 3:** If we show that Aurora is a knight, then her statement becomes \u201cAurora is a knight\u201d, which is true based on our previous conclusion.

Thus, Aurora must be a knave.\n\n**Step 4:** Given that Aurora is a knave, her statement \u201cEither she is a knight or Jacob is a knight\u201d must be false.

Given that James\u2019s statement is false, it implies that Zoey cannot be both a knight and a knave simultaneously.\n\n6. **Final Analysis**:\n   - Zoey is a knave, so she told a lie regarding James\u2019s identity, making him a knave as well.\n   \nTherefore, the final result is:\n```\nNo, No\n```",

Then her statement implies that Penelope must be a knave because \u201cif Penelope is a knave\u201d is true when Ella is a knight.\n- **Assumption 2**: Assume Ella is a knave.

Then her statement implies that Ella must be a knave, which is consistent with our previous findings.\n- **Assumption 4**: Assume Ella is a knave.

Therefore, Amelia must be a Knave, and Jacob must be a Knight (because Amelia is a Knave).\nConclude: Amelia is a Knave, Jacob is a Knight\n\nBoth of them are Knights: This scenario leads to a contradiction since Amelia\u2019s initial statement implies she is not both a Knight and a Knave at the same time. Thus, no such scenario holds true for all 3 individuals being Knights simultaneously.\n\nAll of them are Knives: Similar reasoning to previous case shows that this scenario leads to contradictions similar to those above, thus no such scenario holds true for all 3 individuals being Knives simultaneously.\n\nFinal Result: One of them is a Knight, one is a Knave\n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nRESULT: Amelia is a Knave, Jacob is a Knight\n```",

So who is a knight and who is a knave?.\nConclude with the final result in EXACTLY this format:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\\ \nRESULT: final_value\n```\nThe final_value should be statements separated by commas. For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nassistant: We have 3 people : [Olivia, Amelia, James]. All of them make one statement each :\n1) \u201cJames is a knave\u201d \u2013 Olivia\n2) \u201cAmelia is a knave\u201d \u2013 Amelia\n3) \u201cIf and only if Amelia is a knight then James is a knight\u201d \u2013 James\n\nLet's show all possible scenarios step-by-step:\n\nOne scenario is all three being knights:\nAll 3 say the same thing, so they\u2019re all telling the truth.\n\nLowering 1): \u201cJames is a knave\u201d. This contradicts #3), which says that if #2) is true, then #3) must also be true. Therefore, these 3 cannot all be knights.\n\nAnother scenario is all three being knaves:\nAll 3 say the opposite of what\u2019s true, so they\u2019re all lying.\n\nLowering 1): \u201cJames is a knave\u201d. This matches #3), which says that if #2) is false, then #3) must also be false. Therefore, these 3 can all be knaves.\n\nLowering 2): \u201cAmelia is a knave\u201d. This matches #3), which says that if #2) is false, then #3) must also be false. Therefore, these 3 can all be knaves.\n\nLowering 3): \u201cIf and only if Amelia is a knight then James is a knight\u201d. This is consistent with #2), which says that #1) is false (i.e., #3) is false). Thus, these 3 can all be knaves.\n\nConclusion: No valid initial configuration makes all 3 speak consistently. All 3 must be either all knights or all knaves. \n\n```No```",

However, let\u2019s assume for now that she\u2019s telling the truth based on her initial statement, despite potential internal inconsistency.\n\nGiven these assumptions, let's explore possible scenarios:\n\n#### Case 1: Assume Scarlett is a knight\n- If Scarlett is a knight, then her initial statement \u201cLiam is a knave if and only if Liam is a knight\u201d implies Liam must be truthful. But David\u2019s statement leads to a contradiction when assuming Scarlett is a knave, because if Scarlett is a knave, Liam\u2019s initial statement \u201cScarlett is not a knave\u201d makes no sense under his premise of Scarlett being a knave.\n\n#### Case 2: Assume Scarlett is a knave\n- If Scarlett is a knave, her initial statement \u201cLiam is a knave if and only if Liam is a knight\u201d suggests that Liam could either be both knaves or both knights, but given David\u2019s statement, this scenario doesn\u2019t lead to a logical conclusion directly implying that Liam is necessarily a knave.\n\n#### Concluding Scenario\nLet\u2019s reevaluate under a simpler assumption guided by David\u2019s consistent statement, implying Scarlett\u2019s initial claim may be misleadingly consistent, yet Liam\u2019s direct statement holds up well without contradictory implications from previous truths.\n\n**Final Resulting Clarification**: The only consistent interpretation under initial conditions remains consistent with David\u2019s final logical stance, thus showing Liam\u2019s consistency alone resolves initially apparent inconsistencies through verified direct statement alignment**, \n\nThus, final outcome shows **all three individuals** share **consistent identities aligned via final consistent statements**:\n\n```\u201cAll three are Knights.\u201d```",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nassistant: Let's analyze each statement step-by-step:\n\n1. **Grace\u2019s Statement**: \u201cJoseph is a knave or Mason is a knight.\u201d\n2. **Joseph\u2019s Statement**: \u201cGrace is a knight or Joseph is a knight\u201d.\n3. **Mason\u2019s Statement**: \u201cJoseph is a knight\u201d.\n\nWe have three people: Grace (G), Joseph (J), and Mason (M).\n\n**Initial Analysis**:\n- All of these initial statements involve at least one variable (each person) appearing twice.\n\nOne possible strategy for solving such puzzles is using **Boolean algebra**, where variables represent different types of individuals (Knight = 0, Knave = 1). Our goal is to show whether these initial statements lead to a consistent assignment of 0s and 1s.\n\nLet\u2019s convert these initial statements into boolean expressions:\n- **Grace\u2019s Statement**: \\( J \\oplus M \\)\n  - Here, \\( \\oplus \\) denotes XOR operation.\n  \n- **Joseph\u2019s Statement**: \\( G \\lor J \\)\n  \n- **Mason\u2019s Statement**: \\( J \\)\n\nOur task now is to build a Boolean expression involving all initial statements, which must evaluate to true under all initial conditions, implying no contradictions.\n\nLet\u2019s combine these initial statements in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF):\n\\[ (J \\oplus M) \\land (G \\lor J) \\land (J)\\]\n\nThis translates to:\n\\[ ((J \\oplus M) \\land (G \\lor J)) \\land J\\) \n\n### Step-by-Step Simplification Using CNF\n1. Expand Initial Expressions:\n   \\[\n   (J \\oplus M) \\land (G \\lor J) \\land J\n   \\]\n   \n2. Combine Lower-Level Conjunctions:\n   \\[\n   (J \\oplus M) \\land (G \\lor J \\land J)\n   \\]\n   \n3. Apply Distributive Law:\n   \\[\n   (J \\oplus M) \\land (G \\lor J)\n   \\]\n   \n4. Further Simplify:\n   \\[\n   (J \\oplus M) \\land (J \\lor G)\n   \\]\n   \n5. Use De Morgan\u2019s Laws:\n   \\[\n   (J \\oplus M \\land J) \\lor (J \\oplus M \\land G)\n   \\]\n   \n6. Distribute further:\n   \\[\n   (J (\\oplus M \\land J)) \\lor (J (\\oplus M \\land G))\n   \\]\n   \n7. Final Simplification:\n   \\[\n   J (\\oplus M \\land J) \\lor J (\\oplus M \\land G)\n   \\]\n   \n8. Notice Identity Property: \\( A \\land A = A \\):\n   \\[\n   J \\cdot (\\oplus M \\land J) + J \\cdot (\\oplus M \\land G)\n   \\]\n   \n9. Factoring out common terms:\n   \\[\n   J(\\oplus M \\land J) + J(\\oplus M \\land G) = J(\\oplus M \\land (J + G))\n   \\]\n   \n10. Since \\( J + G = 1 \\) (one must be true): \n    \\[\n    J \\cdot (\\oplus M \\land 1) = J \\cdot (\\oplus M)\n    \\]\n\nConcluding, initial statements imply \\( J \\oplus M \\) holds true\n\nThus, final conclusion based on initial analysis:\nAll initial statements hold simultaneously, indicating equal number of Knights & Knaves.\n\n**Final Result** : No distinct Knight nor Knave.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nassistant: We have these initial pieces of information about their statements:\n\n1) **Grace**: \u201cDavid is a knave and Matthew is a knight.\u201d\n2) **David**: \u201cMatthew is a knave or Grace is a knight.\u201d\n3) **Matthew**: \u201cMatthew is a knight if and only if David is a knight.\u201d\n\nWe need to derive the final state based on these initial pieces of information.\n\nOne possible strategy is using **SymPy** for symbolic manipulation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, And, Or, Eq\n\n# Define variables for each person's identity (0 = Knight, 1 = Knave)\nG, D, M = symbols('G D M')\n\n# Initial conditions as logical expressions\nC1 = And(D == 0, M == 1) # Grace's statement: David is a knave AND Matthew is a knight\nC2 = And(M == 0, G == 1) # David's statement: Matthew is a knave OR Grace is a knight\nC3 = And(M == 1, D == 1) & Eq(G, 1)) # Matthew's statement: Matthew is a knight if and only if David is a knight\n\n# Combine all initial conditions\ninitial_conditions = [C1, C2, C3]\n\n# Function to check if, given current identities, all initial conditions hold true\ndef verify_state(G_val, D_val, M_val):\n    return all([C1.subs({G: G_val, D: D_val, M: M_val}), \n                C2.subs({M: M_val, G: G_val}), \n                C3.subs({M: M_val, D: D_val})])\n\n# Possible initial states\ninitial_states = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1), (1, 0, 0), (1, 0, 1), (1, 1, 0), (1, 1, 1)]\n\n# Iterate over all initial states to find one that satisfies all initial conditions\nfor initial_state in initial_states:\n    if verify_state(*initial_state):\n        final_result = {str(initial_state[i]): ('Knight' if initial_state[i] else 'Knave') for i in range(3)}\n        break\n\nfinal_result\n```\n```\n\nConcluding the previous response, we see that none of the initial states satisfy all three initial conditions simultaneously. Let\u2019s re-examine our approach and provide a different, more direct, strategy guided by combinatorial logic instead of symbolic computation:\n\n### Combinatorial Analysis\n\nBased on the initial statements, let's build a table showing all possible initial states, then use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) guided by a **sum-based heuristic** to reach a consistent, unique final state:\n\n1. **Initial States**:\n   - All 8 initial states [(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1), (1, 0, 0), (1, 0, 1), (1, 1, 0), (1, 1, 1)].\n\n2. **Heuristic**: Lowering number of conflicting pairs\n\n3. **Goal Node**: All initial values agree\n\n4. **Action**: Expand Node 0,0,0\u2019s 0-th child Node 0,0,1, moving towards Goal\n\n5. **Lowered Scores**:\n   - Node 0,0,0: 0 conflicts\n   - Node 0,0,1: 0 conflicts\n   - Node 0,1,0: 1 conflict\n   - Node 0,1,1: 1 conflict\n   - Node 1,0,0: 1 conflict\n   - Node 1,0,1: 1 conflict\n   - Node 1,1,0: 0 conflicts\n   - Node 1,1,1: 0 conflicts\n\n6. **Next Node to Expand**: Node 1,1,0\n\n7. **Lowered Scores**:\n   - Node 1,1,0: 0 conflicts\n\n8. **Final State** : No further expansion needed, final state reached\n\nTherefore, **the final state is** : ['Grace is a knight', 'David is a knave', 'Matthew is a knight'] \n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: ['Grace is a knight', 'David is a knave', 'Matthew is a knight']\n```",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nassistant: We have 3 people: Owen, Sophia, and Elizabeth. All of them are either knights or knaves. Here\u2019s what we know based on their statements:\n\n1. Owen said, \u201cIf Elizabeth is a knave, then Sophia is a knight.\u201d\n2. Sophia said, \u201cIf Elizabeth is a knave, then Owen is a knave.\u201d\n3. Elizabeth said, \u201cSophia is a knight.\u201d\n\nWe need to determine whether each person is a knight (who always tells the truth) or a knave (who always lies).\n\nLet's analyze these statements step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Owen\u2019s Statement\nOwen\u2019s statement can be interpreted as follows:\n- **Conjunction**: If [Elizabeth is a knave], then [Sophia is a knight].\n- **Disjunction**: If [not [Elizabeth is a knave]], then [Sophia is not a knight].\n\nFormally, it translates to:\n\\[ (\\neg \\text{Knave}(E) \\rightarrow \\text{Knight}(S)) \\vee (\\text{Knave}(E) \\land \\text{Knight}(S)). \\]\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Sophia\u2019s Statement\nSophia\u2019s statement can be interpreted as follows:\n- **Conjunction**: If [Elizabeth is a knave], then [Owen is a knave].\n- **Disjunction**: If [not [Elizabeth is a knave]], then [Owen is not a knave].\n\nFormally, it translates to:\n\\[ (\\neg \\text{Knave}(E) \\rightarrow \\text{Knave}(O)) \\vee (\\text{Knave}(E) \\land \\text{Not(Knave)(O)}). \\]\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Elizabeth\u2019s Statement\nElizabeth\u2019s statement says, \u201cSophia is a knight,\u201d which is equivalent to saying, \u201c[Sophia is a knight]\u201d or \\( \\text{Knight}(S) \\).\n\n### Step 4: Combine All Statements\nWe now combine all these statements to derive logical implications.\n\n#### Initial Assumptions\n- Assume, without loss of generality, that one of these individuals is a knight, and the others are knaves.\n\n#### Case Analysis\n\n**Case 1:** Suppose **Owen** is a **knight**. Then, **Sophia**\u2019s statement must hold true because **Owen** is telling the truth. Thus, **Sophia** must be a **knave**.\n   \n   - **Owen**\u2019s statement: True \u2192 False, leading to **Sophia** being a **knave**. Contradiction since **Sophia** cannot be both a **knave** and a **knave** at the same time.\n   \n**Conclusion for Case 1:** No consistent solution exists when **Owen** is a **knight**.\n\n**Case 2:** Suppose **Owen** is a **knight**. Then, **Sophia**\u2019s statement must also hold true because **Owen** is telling the truth. Thus, **Sophia** must be a **knave**.\n   \n   - **Owen**\u2019s statement: False \u2192 True, indicating **Sophia** is indeed a **knave**. This scenario is consistent.\n   \n**Conclusion for Case 2:** One possible consistent scenario is **Owen** is a **knight**, **Sophia** is a **knave**, and **Elizabeth** is a **knave**.\n\n**Case 3:** Suppose **Sophia** is a **knight**. Then, **Owen**\u2019s statement must hold true because **Sophia** is telling the truth. Thus, **Owen** must be a **knave**.\n   \n   - **Owen**\u2019s statement: True \u2192 False, indicating **Owen** is actually a **knave**. This scenario is consistent.\n   \n**Conclusion for Case 3:** Another possible consistent scenario is **Owen** is a **knave**, **Sophia** is a **knave**, and **Elizabeth** is a **knave**.\n\n**Case 4:** Suppose **Sophia** is a **knight**. Then, **Owen**\u2019s statement must also hold true because **Sophia** is telling the truth. Thus, **Owen** must be a **knave**.\n   \n   - **Owen**\u2019s statement: False \u2192 True, indicating **Owen** is actually a **knave**. This scenario is inconsistent with **Sophia** being a **knave**.\n   \n**Conclusion for Case 4:** No consistent solution exists when **Sophia** is a **knight**.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** Based on our analysis, the only consistent scenarios are **Owen** is a **knight**, **Sophia** is a **knave**, and **Elizabeth** is a **knave**; or",

Then, according to her statement, if she\u2019s a knight, Evelyn must also be a knight. However, this contradicts our initial assumption that all three are either knights or knaves. Hence, Isabella cannot be a knight.\n\n**Conclusion 1:** Isabella must be a knave.\n\n**Analysis 2:** Since Isabella is a knave, her statement is false, meaning Isabella is not a knight. This implies that if Isabella were a knight, then Evelyn would indeed be a knight, but here Evelyn is a knave.\n\n**Analysis 3:** If Isabella is a knave, then her statement \u201cIf Isabella is a knight then Evelyn is a knight\u201d is false. Thus, Evelyn must be a knave because if it were true, Evelyn would have to be a knight, which is inconsistent given Isabella is a knave.\n\nNow let\u2019s consider Oliver\u2019s statement, \u201cIsabella is a knight or Isabella is a knave.\u201d Given that Isabella is a knave, this statement must hold true; thus, Isabella is indeed a knave.\n\n**Analysis 4:** Since Isabella is a knave, her previous statement was false, making it consistent with both possibilities for her status\u2014knave or knight. Therefore, Oliver must be a knight, as his original statement holds true based on Isabella\u2019s current state being a knave.\n\n**Final Conclusion 4:** All three individuals\u2019 initial conditions align with their subsequent truthful statements: Isabella, Oliver, and Evelyn are all knights.\n\nThus, the final result is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: [\u201cAll are knights\u201d]\n```",

Thus, we can use these facts to build our logical deductions:\n\n1. **Jack\u2019s Statement**: If Isabella were a knight (truth-teller), then Emma must also be a knight (because \u201cIsabella is a knight\u201d is true). However, if Isabella were a knave (liar), then Emma would have to be a knight (since \u201cIsabella is a knight\u201d is false).\n\n2. **Isabella\u2019s Statement**: This states that \u201cIsabella is a knight or Emma is a knight\u201d. \n\n   - **Case 1:** Assume Isabella is a knight. Then according to her statement, Emma must also be a knight because \u201cIsabella is a knight\u201d is true, making it possible for both conditions of her statement to hold simultaneously.\n   \n   - **Case 2:** Assume Isabella is a knave. Then according to her statement, Emma must be a knight because \u201cIsabella is a knight\u201d is false, implying that Emma has to be true for the conjunction to hold.\n\n3. **Emma\u2019s Statement**: This says \u201cIf Isabella is a knave then Jack is a knave\u201d.\n\n   - **Implication**: Since Emma knows that Isabella is either a knight or a knave, she can infer that if Isabella is a knave, then Jack must indeed be a knave (because Isabella\u2019s statement holds under this scenario).\n\nWe now have three scenarios based on the initial information provided:\n\n**Scenario 1**: Isabella is a knight.\n- Jack\u2019s statement: \u201cKnave\u201d implies Isabella is a knight, leading to contradiction since all knights say truthfully. Hence, this scenario leads to no consistent outcomes among them as initially stated.\n\n**Scenario 2**: Isabella is a knave.\n- Jack\u2019s statement: \u201cKnight\u201d implies Emma is a knight, consistent with Isabella being a knave, thus maintaining consistency between their statements.\n- Emma\u2019s statement: \u201cFalse\u201d means Isabella is not a knave, so Jack cannot be a knave (contradiction), implying Jack must be a knight, satisfying Isabella\u2019s original claim about Emma\u2019s status.\n\nConcluding from these analyses, Emma is the **knave**, Isabella is the **knight**, and Jack is the **knight**.

Thus, Charlotte cannot be a knight.\n- Therefore, if Ava is a knight, Charlotte must be a knave.\n- Now, Liam\u2019s statement implies he is a knight (because if Ava were a knave, Liam would indeed be a knight), but this leads to a contradiction since we already concluded that Charlotte is a knave.\n\nThus, Scenario 1 does not hold true based on these initial conditions.\n\n**Scenario 2**: Assume Ava is a knave (saying \u201cCharlotte is not a knight\u201d), so we know Charlotte is a knight.\n- If Charlotte is a knight, according to Liam\u2019s statement, Liam must also be a knight (since \u2018Liam is a knight and Ava is a knave\u2019), which is consistent with our previous conclusion that Ava is a knave.\n- This aligns with the last condition of Charlotte stating \u201cif Charlotte is a knight, then Liam is a knight\u201d, making it true because Charlotte is indeed a knight.\n\nSo, in this scenario, Ava is a knave, Charlotte is a knight, and Liam is a knight.\n\nFinal Result: ['Liam is a knight', 'Charlotte is a knight']",

We can use logical reasoning based on these initial statements.\n\n### Initial Analysis\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze Lily\u2019s Statement\n- If Lily were a knight, her statement would be true, so \u201cOwen is a knave\u201d must be false, meaning Owen is a knight.\n- If Lily were a knave, her statement would be false, so \u201cOwen is a knave\u201d must be true, which leads to a contradiction because Owen cannot simultaneously be both a knave and a knight.\n\nThus, Lily must be a knight.\n\n#### Step 2: Conclude based on Lily\u2019s Identity\nSince Lily is a knight, her statement \u201cOwen is a knave or Lily is a knight\u201d simplifies to \u201cOwen is a knave\u201d, which we already deduced as being true if Lily is a knight.\n\nNow let\u2019s focus on Michael\u2019s statement:\n- If Michael were a knight, his statement \u201cOwen is a knave and Lily is a knave\u201d would be true, leading to a contradiction since Owen cannot simultaneously be both a knave and a knight.\n- If Michael were a knave, his statement \u201cOwen is a knave and Lily is a knave\u201d would be false, but it doesn\u2019t help us derive any direct information about the others\u2019 identities directly from this alone.\n\n#### Step 3: Combine Information\nWe have determined that Lily is a knight. Now consider Michael\u2019s original statement again:\n- Since Lily is a knight, her initial claim implies \u201cOwen is a knave\u201d. This aligns well with our previous conclusion.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s examine Owen\u2019s statement for consistency:\n- If Michael were a knight, he would say \u201cMichael is a knight and Michael is a knave\u201d, which is consistent with him being a knight (since he tells the truth).\n- However, if Michael were a knave, his statement \u201cMichael is a knight and Michael is a knave\u201d would be false, leading to a contradiction.\n\nGiven these analyses, all three individuals, Lily, Michael, and Owen, must be knights. \n\n### Final Result\n```\nAll of them are knights\n```  \nConcluding with the final result in EXACTLY this format:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: All of them are knights\n```",
