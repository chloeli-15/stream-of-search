Ava's statement: \"If Sebastian is a knight then Ava is a knight\" (false)\n\nFrom the second statement, we can conclude that Ava cannot be a knight because if she were a knight, Sebastian would have to be a knave, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, Ava must be a knave.\n\nNow, let's analyze Sebastian's statement:\nSince Ava is a knave, her statement \"If Sebastian is a knight then Ava is a knight\" is false.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nQUICK REASONING: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Jackson and Lily. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Jackson's Statement**: \"Lily is a knave or Jackson is a knight\"\n   - This means that if Lily is a knave, then Jackson must be a knight.\n   - If Lily is a knight, then Jackson must also be a knight.\n\n2. **Lily's Statement**: \"Jackson is a knight\"\n   - From Jackson's initial statement, we know that if Jackson is a knight, then Lily must be a knave.\n   - Since Lily is a knight, Jackson cannot be a knight, so his statement must be false.\n\n3. **Conclusion from Step 2**: Since Jackson's statement is false, Lily must be a knave.\n   - Therefore, Lily is a knave.\n\n4. **Current State of Jackson**: Since Lily is a knave, Jackson cannot be a knight (from Jackson's initial statement). Therefore, Jackson must be a knave.\n   - Current state: Jackson is a knave, Lily is a knave.\n\n5. **Verification**: Check all initial conditions:\n   - Jackson's statement: \"Lily is a knave or Jackson is a knight\" becomes true because Lily is a knave.\n   - Lily's statement: \"Jackson is a knight\" becomes false because Jackson is a knave.\n   - Both conditions are satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Jackson is a knave, Lily is a knave\n```\n",

Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Owen's Statement**: \"Sebastian is a knight or Sebastian is a knave.\"\n   - If Sebastian is a knight, then Owen must be a knave (since knights always tell the truth).\n   - If Sebastian is a knave, then both Owen and Sebastian are knaves (since knaves always lie).\n\n2. **Sebastian's Statement**: \"Owen is a knave or Owen is a knight.\"\n   - If Owen is a knave, then both Owen and Sebastian are knaves, which contradicts Owen's statement that Sebastian is a knave.\n   - Therefore, Owen must be a knight.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Since Owen is a knight, his statement about Sebastian being either a knight or a knave is false. This means Sebastian must be a knave.\n\nThus, Sebastian is a knave and Owen is a knight.\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Sebastian: knave, Owen: knight\n```",

This leads us to the conclusion that Joseph, who claims Grace is a knave, is lying, so Joseph is actually a knave.\nFrom step 3, if Emma is a knave, then Joseph is a knight, and Ethan is a knight because he states that if Emma is a knave, then Joseph is a knight.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nQUICK REASONING: To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement based on the rules of knight-knave logic. Let's go through them step by step:\n\n1. **Amelia's Statement**: \"Isabella is not a knave\" (True)\n2. **Isabella's Statement**: \"Liam is not a knave\" (False, since Isabella is a knave)\n3. **Liam's Statement**: \"Isabella is a knave or Amelia is a knight\" (True, because Isabella is a knave)\n4. **Isabella's Statement**: \"Liam is not a knave\" (False, since Isabella is a knave)\n\nNow let's use this information to deduce the roles of Amelia, Liam, and Isabella:\n\n- From statement 1, we know that Isabella cannot be a knave. Therefore, she must be a knight.\n- From statement 2, if Isabella is a knight, then Liam must be a knave (since he can't be a knave according to statement 1).\n- From statement 3, if Isabella is a knight, then Liam cannot be a knave (since he is a knave). This means Liam must be a knave.\n- From statement 4, if Liam is a knave, then Isabella must be a knight (since she can't be a knave according to statement 2).\n\nThus, the final states are:\n- Isabella: Knight\n- Liam: Knave\n- Amelia: Knight\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Knight, Knave, Knight\n```\n",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nQUICK REASONING: To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement carefully based on the given information about knights and knaves. Let's go through them step-by-step:\n\n1. **Statement from Matthew:** \"Aiden is a knave and Aiden is a knight\"\n2. **Statement from Oliver:** \"Oliver is a knave if and only if Oliver is a knight\"\n3. **Observation from Oliver:** \"Aiden is a knight\"\n\nFirst, let's use Statement 1 to determine if Aiden is a knight or a knave:\n- From Statement 1, Aiden must be a knave because he says he is a knave.\n\nNow, using Statement 3, since Aiden is a knave, Oliver must also be a knave. This contradicts Statement 2, which states that Oliver is a knight. Therefore, Statement 2 must be false.\n\nSince Statement 2 is false, Statement 1 cannot be true. Thus, Aiden must be a knave.\n\nNext, let's use Statement 1 again, but this time focusing on Oliver:\n- Since Aiden is a knave, Oliver can either be a knight or a knave.\n- If Oliver were a knight, then Statement 2 would be true, which is consistent with Statement 1.\n- If Oliver were a knave, then Statement 2 would be false, which is not consistent with Statement 1.\n\nTherefore, Oliver must be a knave.\n\nIn conclusion, Oliver is a knave, and Aiden is a knight.

From Emma's statement, if Sophia is a knight, then Charlotte must be a knave. Since Sophia is not a knight, this is impossible. Therefore, Emma must be a knave.\n3. From Sophia's statement, if Emma is a knave, then she must be a knave as well. This is consistent with our previous conclusion about Emma being a knave.\n4. From Charlotte's statement, if Emma is a knave, then it must be Sophia's turn to say something true or false. Since Emma is a knave, Charlotte must be telling the truth. Therefore, Charlotte is a knight.\n\nConcluding statement: Charlotte is a knight, Emma is a knave, and Sophia is a knave.",

So who is a knight and who is a knave?.\nConclude with the final result in EXACTLY this format:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\\ \nRESULT: final_value\n```\nThe final_value should be statements separated by commas. For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nQUANTITIES:\n- Mason: Knight, Knave\n- Sophia: Knight, Knave\n- Michael: Knight, Knave\nExploring Statements:\n1. Mason's Statement: \"Michael is a knave if and only if Michael is a knight\"\n2. Sophia's Statement: \"Mason is a knight and Michael is a knight\"\n3. Michael's Statement: \"Sophia is a knave or Mason is a knave\"\n\nLet's analyze these statements step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing Michael's Statement\n\\[ \\text{M}:\\text{Michael is a knave if and only if Michael is a knight} \\]\nThis implies that for any Michael to be a knave, he must also be a knight.\n\n### Step 2: Exploring Sophia's Statement\n\\[ \\text{S}\\text{: } \\text{M}:\\text{Michael is a knave and Michael is a knight} \\]\nFrom this statement, we know Michael is both a knave and a knight, which contradicts our initial assumption that Michael is a knave. Therefore, Sophia cannot be a knight.\n\n### Step 3: Exploring Michael's Statement\n\\[ \\text{M}: \\text{Sophia is a knave or} \\text{Michael is a knave} \\]\nSince Sophia is a knave, this statement is false. Therefore, Michael must be a knave.\n\nNow let's consider Michael's current state:\n\\[ \\text{M}: \\text{Michael is a knave} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing Sophia's Statement\n\\[ \\text{S}\\text{: } \\text{M}:\\text{Michael is a knave and Michael is a knight} \\]\nIf Michael is a knave, then from Sophia's statement, Michael must be a knight. However, from the previous analysis, we know Michael is a knave, which contradicts this conclusion. This contradiction indicates an error in our initial assumptions.\n\nGiven the contradictions, let's re-evaluate using only the original statements:\n\n### Re-Evaluating Using Only Original Statements:\n1. \\( M: K \\) (Mason is a knave)\n2. \\( S: K \\) (Sophia is a knave)\n3. \\( M: K \\) (Michael is a knave)\n\nFrom \\( S: K \\), we know \\( M: K \\). From \\( M: K \\), Michael must be a knave, but from \\( S: K \\), Sophia is a knave. This creates a logical inconsistency.\n\n### Conclusion:\nFrom the initial statements, it appears there is no consistent solution. Let's re-examine the possible states based on the given constraints:\n\n1. \\( M: K \\) (Mason is a knave)\n2. \\( S: K \\) (Sophia is a knave)\n3. \\( M: K \\) (Michael is a knave)\n\nThese states lead to contradictions:\n- If Michael is a knave, then Sophia is a knave, which is inconsistent.\n- If Sophia is a knave, then Michael must be a knave, which is also inconsistent.\n\nThus, there is no valid solution under the given constraints.\n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nRESULT: No Solution\n```",

Avery claims: \"If Avery is a knight then Emma is a knight.\"\n2. Emma states: \"Avery is not a knave.\"\n3. Aria states: \"Avery is a knight.\"\n\nFirst, let's use Avery's statement to understand what happens if Avery is a knight:\n- If Avery is a knight, Avery is true. Therefore, Emma must also be a knight.\n\nNow we know that both Avery and Emma are knights. Next, let's use Emma's statement to understand what happens if Emma is a knight:\n- If Emma is a knight, Avery must be a liar. Therefore, Avery must be a knave.\n\nFinally, let's use Aria's statement to understand what happens if Aria is a knight:\n- If Aria is a knight, Avery must be a knight. Therefore, Emma must be a knave.\n\nFrom these steps, we can conclude that Avery is a knave, Emma is a knight, and Aria is a knave.",

This means Ella is a knave.\n- From Statement 2: If Aurora is a knight, Matthew is a knight. Since Aurora is a knight, Matthew must also be a knight. This satisfies both Statements 1 and 2.\n- From Statement 3: Ella is a knave, so Ella must not be telling the truth. This contradicts Statement 3.\n\nExploring Scenario 2: Aurora is a knave, Matthew is a knave\n- From Statement 1: Aurora is a knave, so Aurora must be lying. This means Ella is a knave.\n- From Statement 2: If Aurora is a knave, Matthew is a knave. Since Aurora is a knave, Matthew must be a knave. This satisfies both Statements 1 and 2.\n- From Statement 3: Ella is a knave, so Ella must not be telling the truth.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nQUICK REASONING: To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement made by the inhabitants based on their roles as knights or knaves. Let's go through them step-by-step:\n\n1. **Jacob's Statement**: \"Chloe is a knight if and only if Jacob is a knight.\"\n   - If Jacob is a knight (T), then Chloe must also be a knight (K) because all knights always tell the truth. This creates a contradiction since Jacob cannot be both a knight and a knave at the same time.\n   - Therefore, Jacob must be a knave (F).\n\n2. **Chloe's Statement**: \"If Jacob is a knight then Jacob is a knave.\"\n   - Since Jacob is a knave, this statement is false. It means that Chloe is a knight, which contradicts our previous conclusion that Jacob is a knave.\n\n3. **Aria's Statement**: \"Jacob is a knight.\"\n   - Since Jacob is a knave, Aria's statement \"Jacob is a knight\" is false. This confirms that Jacob is indeed a knave.\n\nBased on these analyses, we can conclude:\n- Jacob is a knave.\n- Chloe is a knight.\n- Aria is a knave.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nRESULT: [Jacob, Chloe, Aria] = []\n```",

From Emily's statement, E must be a knight because she cannot be a knave from the initial state.\n3. From Grace's statement, if E is a knight, then G must be a knave.

From Grace's statement, if G is a knave, then E must be a knight. Since E is a knight, this condition is satisfied.\n2. From Emily's statement, if E is a knight, then G must be a knave. This directly contradicts the previous conclusion that G is a knave, as it creates a contradiction.\n\nCurrent State after Conclusion #2:\n[N, K, K] (E: K, G: K, S: N)\n\nExploring Current State #3:\n1.

From current state, all individuals are either knights or knaves, which matches our goal of having exactly 2 knights and 1 knave.\n\nSince both Conclusion #1 and Conclusion #2 lead to identical final states, we reach the conclusion that both Samuels and Grace are knaves, while Emily is a knight.\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: [K, K, N, K]\n```",

Let's go through them step by step:\n\n1. **Harper's Statement:** \"Mia is not a knave.\"\n   - This implies that Mia must be a knave because she cannot be a knight if she is not a knave.\n\n2. **Evelyn's Statement:** \"Mia is a knave.\"\n   - From Harper's statement, we know Mia is a knave. Therefore, Evelyn must be a knight because she can't be a knave (since all knights are telling the truth).\n\n3. **Mia's Statement:** \"Harper is a knight and Evelyn is a knight.\"\n   - From this statement, we know that Harper is a knight, which is true according to Harper's statement. Also, since Evelyn is a knight, her statement is true, which is consistent with Harper being a knight.\n\nCombining these results:\n- Harper is a knight.\n- Evelyn is a knight.\n- Mia is a knight.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Knight, Knight, Knight\n```",

This means that if Matthew is a knight, then Matthew must be a knave. Since knights always tell the truth, this directly leads us to conclude that Matthew is a knave.\nExploring_option_2: Now let's consider Matthew's statement about Owen being a knight if and only if Abigail is a knave. This implies that if Owen is a knight, then Abigail must also be a knave. Given that Matthew is a knave, this creates a contradiction because Owen cannot be both a knight and a knave at the same time.\nExploring_option_3: Finally, Owen's statement, \"Matthew is not a knight,\" supports our conclusion that Matthew is a knave. If Matthew were a knight, he would have told the truth in his initial statement, which is inconsistent with Owen's statement.\n```\nResult: YES\nSolution: YES\n```\n",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nQUICK REASONING: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Riley, Amelia, and Ethan based on the given information about knights and knaves. We'll use logical reasoning to determine who is a knight and who is a knave.\n\n```\nExploring Initial Statements:\n1. Amelia is not a knight: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, [0-9] from 1234567890\n2. Riley's statement: \"Amelia is not a knight\" -> B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, [0-9]\n3. Amelia's statement: \"Riley is a knight or Amelia is a knight\" -> [B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, [0-9]] = [F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, [0-9]]\n4. Ethan's statement: \"Riley is a knight and Ethan is a knight\" -> [B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, [0-9], [0-9]] = [B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, [0-9]]\n\nCurrent State: [B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, [0-9], [0-9]]\nExploring Next Steps:\n5. From Statement 3, we know that all knights (B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) are involved. All non-knights (C, E, E, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) must also be involved since they can't be involved with any of these initial knights.\n6. From Statement 4, we know that only knights (B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) are involved. All non-knights (C, E, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) must also be involved since they can't be involved with any of these initial knights.\n7. Since all initial knights are involved, all initial non-knights are involved as well. This means all initial inhabitants are involved in some way, which contradicts the initial condition that only knights are present.\n\nTherefore, no solution exists under the given conditions.\n```\n```\n```\n```\n",

Victoria's claim: \"If Daniel is a knave then Amelia is a knave\" leads to 3 possible scenarios: Daniel is a knave, Amelia is a knave, or both are knaves. Let's analyze these scenarios based on Mia's initial statement.\n3. Amelia's claim: \"If Mia is a knight then Victoria is a knight\" leads to 3 possible scenarios: Mia is a knight, Victoria is a knight, or both are knights. Now we need to combine information from Mia's and Victoria's initial claims with Amelia's claim to reach a conclusion.\n\nExploring Scenario 1: Mia is a knight\n- From Mia's initial claim, we know that Mia must be a knight because she is telling the truth.\n- If Mia is a knight, then Victoria must be a knave (since she lies).\n- From Victoria's initial claim, we know that Victoria must be a knave because she lies.\n- From Amelia's initial claim, we know that Victoria must be a knave (since she lies) because she is a knave.\n- This scenario is consistent with all initial conditions.\n\nExploring Scenario 2: Victoria is a knave\n- From Victoria's initial claim, we know that Victoria must be a knave because she lies.\n- If Victoria is a knave, then Amelia must be a knight (since she tells the truth).\n- From Amelia's initial claim, we know that Amelia must be a knight because she is telling the truth.\n- This scenario is also consistent with all initial conditions.\n\nConcluding Statements:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Scenario 1: Mia is a knight, Victoria is a knave, Amelia is a knight; Scenario 2: Mia is a knight, Victoria is a knave, Amelia is a knight\n```\n```\n",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nQUANTIFYING:\nExploring initial conditions:\n1. Sophia: \"Harper is a knight and Mia is a knight\" -> Possible: Sophia, Mia, Harper, Knight\n2. Mia: \"If Harper is a knight then Harper is a knave\" -> Possible: Harper, Knight\n3. Harper: \"Emily is a knight if and only if Mia is a knave\" -> Possible: Emily, Knight, Mia, Knave\n4. Emily: \"If Harper is a knight then Mia is a knight\" -> Possible: Emily, Knight, Mia, Knave\n\nCurrent State: 4 people, 3 statements, 2 unknowns. Exploring further based on initial knowledge.\n\nExploring from statement 1: Since Harper is a knight, Harper must be a knight or a knave. If Harper is a knight, statement 2 implies that Mia must be a knave (since if Mia were a knight, Harper would be a knave). If Harper is a knave, statement 2 doesn't change anything because it already says that Mia is a knave. Statement 3 also states that Emily is a knight if and only if Mia is a knave. This means that if Mia is a knave, Emily must be a knight, and if Mia is a knight, Emily must be a knave. However, we need to check if these scenarios lead to a contradiction with other statements.\n\nExploring from statement 2: If Harper is a knight, statement 2 is always true. No new information is gained from this statement.\n\nExploring from statement 3: If Harper is a knight, Emily is a knight if and only if Mia is a knave. This is consistent with our previous findings.\n\nExploring from statement 4: If Harper is a knight, Mia is a knave. From statement 2, Mia must be a knave. From statement 3, Emily must be a knight.\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Sophia, Mia, Harper, Knight, Emily, Knave\n```\n```\n\nPlease determine whether the given text is true or false.

We know that knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.\n\n1. **David's Statement**: \"Aurora is a knight or David is a knight.\"\n   - If David is a knight, then David must be telling the truth, so Aurora must also be a knight.\n   - If David is a knave, then David must be lying, so Aurora must be a knave.\n   - This creates a contradiction because if Aurora is a knave, David cannot be a knight (a contradiction). Therefore, David must be a knight.\n\n2. **Sofia's Statement**: \"If Sofia is a knight then Jackson is a knight.\"\n   - If Sofia is a knight, then Sofia must be a knight.\n   - If Aurora is a knave, then Aurora must be a knave.\n   - This means Jackson must be a knave because he is the only one who could contradict Sofia being a knight.\n   - Since Aurora is a knave, Jackson cannot be a knave, which contradicts our previous conclusion that Jackson is a knave.\n\n3. **Aurora's Statement**: \"David is not a knight.\"\n   - From David's statement, we know David is a knight.\n   - Since David is a knight, his statement must be true, so Aurora must be a knave.\n   - Since Aurora is a knave, her statement must be false, so Sofia must be a knight.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: David is a knight, Sofia is a knave, Aurora is a knave, Jackson is a knave\n```\n",

Elizabeth noted, \"Scarlett is a knave or Scarlett is a knight\". \"Benjamin is not a knight\" - Zoey. Scarlett noted, \"Zoey is a knave if and only if Elizabeth is a knight\". Benjamin said, \"Elizabeth is a knight or Elizabeth is a knave.\" So who is a knight and who is a knave?.\nConclude with the final result in EXACTLY this format:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\\ \nRESULT: final_value\n```\nThe final_value should be statements separated by commas. For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nQUANTIFYING:\n1. Elizabeth's statement: \"Scarlett is a knave or Scarlett is a knight\"\n2. Benjamin's statement: \"Elizabeth is a knight or Elizabeth is a knave\"\n3. Scarlett's statement: \"Zoey is a knave if and only if Elizabeth is a knight\"\n4. Benjamin's statement: \"Elizabeth is a knight or Elizabeth is a knave\"\n\nExploring from left to right:\n- From Elizabeth's first statement: Since Elizabeth says \"Scarlett is a knave or Scarlett is a knight\", we have two possibilities:\n  1. Elizabeth is a knave (KKN)\n  2. Elizabeth is a knight (KKN)\n- From Elizabeth's second statement: Since Elizabeth says \"Scarlett is a knave or Scarlett is a knight\", we again have two possibilities:\n  1. Elizabeth is a knave (KKN)\n  2. Elizabeth is a knight (KKN)\n- From Elizabeth's third statement: Since Elizabeth says \"Zoey is a knave if and only if Elizabeth is a knight\", we have three possible scenarios:\n  1. Zoey is a knave (KKN, KKN) -> This contradicts our previous scenario (KKN)\n  2. Zoey is a knight (KKN, KKN) -> This also contradicts our previous scenario (KKN)\n  3. Both Zoey and Scarlett are knights (KKK) -> This satisfies both Elizabeth's first and second statements\n\nFrom scenario 3, we can conclude that:\n```\nSolution: YES\nResult: KKN,KKN,KKK\n```\n```\n```\n```\nCurrent State: KKN,KKN,KKK\nExploring from right to left:\n- From Benjamin's first statement: \"Elizabeth is a knight or Elizabeth is a knave\" (KKN), since KKN = KKN, this statement does not provide new information\n- From Benjamin's second statement: \"Elizabeth is a knight or Elizabeth is a knave\" (KKN), since KKN = KKN, this statement does not provide new information\n```\n```\n",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nQUICK REASONING: To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement using the rules of knights and knaves. Let's go through them step-by-step:\n\n1. **Joseph's Statement:** \"Aria is not a knave.\"\n   - If Joseph is a knight, then Aria must be a knave (because knights always tell the truth).\n   - If Joseph is a knave, then Aria cannot be a knave, which contradicts his initial statement. Therefore, Joseph must be a knight.\n\n2. **William's Statement:** \"Aria is not a knight.\"\n   - Since Joseph is a knight, Aria must be a knave.\n   - If Aria is a knave, then William must be a knight (because knights always tell the truth).\n   - If William is a knight, then William's statement is true, which matches our previous conclusion that Joseph is a knight.\n\n3. **Isabella's Statement:** \"William is a knight if and only if Joseph is a knave.\"\n   - From William's statement, if William is a knight, then Joseph must be a knave.\n   - From Isabella's statement, if William is a knight, then Aria must be a knave.\n   - However, since Joseph is already known to be a knight, there is no contradiction here. This statement seems to be based on an assumption about William being a knight, but it doesn't directly affect the current information.\n\n4. **Aria's Statement:** \"Isabella is not a knave.\"\n   - Since Joseph is a knight, Isabella must be a knave (because knights always tell the truth).\n   - From Aria's statement, if Isabella is a knave, then Aria must be a knave as well.\n   - This directly confirms that both Aria and Isabella are knaves.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Aria is a knave, Isabella is a knave, Joseph is a knight, William is a knave\n```\n",

Therefore, Charlotte must be a knave because she cannot be a knight based on Olivia's statement.\n\n3. **Charlotte's Statement:** \"Charlotte is not a knight.\"\n   - From the first statement, we know that if Harper is a knight, then Owen must be a knave. Since Owen is a knave, this statement is false.\n\n4. **Owen's Statement:** \"Charlotte is not a knight.\"\n   - Since Charlotte is a knave from the previous step, this statement is also false.\n\nBased on these initial findings, we can conclude:\n- Charlotte is a knave.\n- Owen is a knight.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: [Charlotte, Owen] are knights, [Olivia, Harper] are knaves\n```",

From Statement 4, if Ella is a knight, then Harper must be a knave, which contradicts Statement 2. Therefore, Ella must be a knave.\\nFrom Statement 5, if Ella is a knave, then Riley must be a knight.

Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 4 inhabitants: Harper, David, Samuel, and Grace. \"If Samuel is a knight then Grace is a knave\" - Harper. David asserted: \"Samuel is a knight if and only if David is a knight\". Samuel stated, \"Harper is not a knight\". Grace said that David is a knight. So who is a knight and who is a knave?.\nConclude with the final result in EXACTLY this format:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\\ \nRESULT: final_value\n```\nThe final_value should be statements separated by commas. For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nQUICK REASONING: To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement using the rules of knights and knaves from logic. Let's break down each statement step-by-step:\n\n1. **Harper's Statement:** If Samuel is a knight then Grace is a knave. From this, we know that if Samuel is a knight, Grace must be a knave, and vice versa. This gives us two possible scenarios:\n   - Samuel is a knight, so Grace is a knave: S -> G (True)\n   - Samuel is a knave, so Grace is a knight: G -> F (False)\n\n2. **David's Statement:** \"Samuel is a knight if and only if David is a knight.\" From this, we know that for any knight \\(K\\) and any knight \\(L\\), \\(K \\leftrightarrow L\\) holds true. This implies that if David is a knight, then Samuel must also be a knight, and if David is a knave, then Samuel must also be a knave.\n\n3. **Samuel's Statement:** \"Harper is not a knight.\" From this, we know that if Harper is a knight, then he is a knight, and if Harper is a knave, then he is a knave. Therefore, Harper cannot be a knight because if he were, he would be a knave based on his initial statement.\n\n4. **Grace's Statement:** \"David is a knight.\" From this, we know that David is a knight, which satisfies the first part of the rule (if David is a knight, then Samuel must be a knight).\n\nNow let's use these pieces of information to determine who is a knight and who is a knave:\n\n- From Harper's statement, \\(S \\rightarrow G\\): Since David is a knight, Samuel is a knight.\n- From David's statement, \\(G \\leftrightarrow F\\): Since Samuel is a knight, David must be a knight.\n- From Samuel's statement, \\(H \\rightarrow K\\): Since Harper is not a knight, David must be a knight.\n- From Grace's statement, \\(D \\rightarrow K\\): Since David is a knight, Grace must be a knight.\n\nCombining all these results, we get:\n- David is a knight, since he is given as a knight.\n- Samuel is a knight, since he is given as a knight.\n- Grace is a knight, since she is given as a knight.\n- Harper is a knave, since she is given as a knave.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Knight, Knight, Knight, Knave\n```\n",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nQUICK REASONING: To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement step-by-step using the rules of logic. Let's go through them one by one:\n\n1. **Jackson's Statement**: \"James is a knight if and only if James is a knave.\"\n2. **Owen's Statement**: \"If Grace is a knave then Owen is a knight.\"\n3. **Grace's Statement**: \"James is not a knave.\"\n4. **James's Statement**: \"Owen is a knave.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze Jackson's Statement\n**Jackson says:** \"James is a knight if and only if James is a knave.\"\nThis can be written as: \\( J \\rightarrow K \\) (J is a knight if and only if K is a knight).\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze Owen's Statement\n**Owen says:** \"If Grace is a knave then Owen is a knight.\"\nThis can be written as: \\( G \\rightarrow O \\) (Grace is a knave implies Owen is a knight).\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze Grace's Statement\n**Grace says:** \"James is not a knave.\"\nThis means \\( J \\neq K \\).\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze James's Statement\n**James says:** \"Owen is a knave.\"\nThis means \\( O = K \\), since Owen is already a knight.\n\nNow let's combine these initial conditions:\n\n1. From Jackson's statement: \\( J \\rightarrow K \\)\n2. From Owen's statement: \\( G \\rightarrow O \\) (implies \\( G = K \\))\n3. From Grace's statement: \\( J \\neq K \\) (implies \\( J = O = K \\))\n4. From James's statement: \\( O = K \\)\n\nSince \\( J = O = K \\), all three statements must be equalities. This leaves us with:\n\\[ J = O = K \\]\n\nGiven \\( J = O = K \\), the only possible value for \\( K \\) is \\( 0 \\). Since \\( J = O = K \\), \\( K = 0 \\) is also true.\n\nTherefore, both Jackson and Owen are knights, and James is a knave. Both Jackson and Owen are knights, so they satisfy all initial conditions.\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: 0,0\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: 0,0\n```",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nQUICK REVIEW:\n- Knights always tell the truth.\n- Knaves always lie.\n- There are only two types of people on the island: knights and knaves.\n- We need to determine if each person is a knight or a knave using the given statements.\nExploring Initial Statements:\n1. Penelope: If Penelope is a knight, then Luke is a knight. (P -> L)\n2. Victoria: If Victoria is a knight, then Luke is a knight. (V -> L)\n3. Penelope: Penelope is a knave. (P' = K)\n4. Noah: Luke is a knight. (LK)\n5. Victoria: Luke is a knight. (LK)\n\nCurrent State: P -> L, V -> L, P' = K, LK, LK\n\nExploring Subsequent Statements Using Knowledge from Initial Conditions:\nFrom Statement 1: If Penelope is a knight, then Luke is a knight. Since P -> L, P' = K, so if P = K, then L must also be K. This eliminates all other possibilities for P and L.\nFrom Statement 2: If Victoria is a knight, then Luke is a knight. Since V -> L, LK, so if V = K, then L = K. This confirms that L = K.\n\nConclusion: From Statement 1 and Statement 2, we have determined that L = K. Therefore, all other statements involving L will be false because they would require L to be either true or false, but we already know L = K.\n\nFinal Result: All statements are now true, confirming that L = K.

From this, we can infer that all knights must agree on whether Zoe is a knave or not, as they cannot both be knaves at the same time.\nExploring Situation #2: Sofia says \"If Zoey is a knave then Zoey is a knight\", which implies that if Zoey is a knave, she is actually a knight, and if Zoey is a knight, she is indeed a knave. This narrows down the possibilities for other people, but doesn't directly lead to any conclusions about Zoey's status.\nExploring Situation #3: Zoey says \"Lucas is a knave and Lucas is a knight\", which confirms that both Zoe and Lucas are knights.\nExploring Situation #4: Lucas says \"Zoey is a knight\", which contradicts our previous findings that all knights must agree on whether Zoe is a knave or not.\nExploring Situation #5: All initial conditions (including ZOE being a KNIGHT) are now satisfied, so no further changes are necessary.\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: ZOE,KNIGHT,ZOY,KNIGHT\n```\n",

Since Jackson is a knight, Daniel must also be a knight because all knights tell the truth. Therefore, Daniel is a knight.\n\nSo, we have:\n- Jackson is a knight\n- Daniel is a knight\n\nNext, let's consider Scenario 4: Scorpio's Statement. If Aurora is a knight, then Aurora is a knave (from Step 3), which contradicts the given condition that if Aurora is a knight then Aurora is a knave. Therefore, Aurora cannot be a knight.\n\nSince Aurora cannot be a knight, she must be a knave.\n\nNow, we have:\n- Jackson is a knight\n- Daniel is a knight\n- Aurora is a knave\n\nFinally, let's verify all conditions:\n- Jackson is a knight (from Step 1)\n- Daniel is a knight (from Step 2)\n- Aurora is a knave (from Step 3)\n\nAll conditions are satisfied.\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: 1,2,3,4\n```\n",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nassistant\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.\n```\nExploring the initial information:\n1. Chloe says if Sofia is a knight, then Olivia is a knave. This implies that if Chloe is a knight, then Olivia must be a knave, which contradicts Chloe being a knight (since she would say this).\n2. \"Chloe is a knave if and only if Olivia is a knight\" states that if Chloe is a knave, then Olivia is a knight, which is consistent with Chloe being a knight.\n3. \"Olivia is a knight if and only if Chloe is a knave\" states that if Olivia is a knight, then Chloe must be a knave, which again is consistent with Chloe being a knight.\n\nGiven these contradictions, there seems to be an inconsistency in the initial statements. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate using different logical steps.\n\nLet's consider all possible scenarios:\n1. Assume Chloe is a knight.\n2. If Chloe is a knight, then Olivia must be a knave based on Chloe saying Sofia is a knight.\n3. If Chloe is a knight, then Chloe must be a knave based on Chloe saying Sofia is a knight.\n4. If Chloe is a knight, then Sofia must be a knight based on Chloe saying Sofia is a knight.\n5. If Chloe is a knight, then Sophia must be a knight based on Chloe saying Sofia is a knight.\n6. If Chloe is a knight, then Alexander must be a knight based on Chloe saying Sofia is a knight.\n7. If Chloe is a knight, then Alexander must be a knave based on Chloe saying Sofia is a knight.\n8. If Chloe is a knight, then Alexander must be a knight based on Chloe saying Sofia is a knight.\n9. If Chloe is a knight, then Alexander must be a knave based on Chloe saying Sofia is a knight.\n10. If Chloe is a knight, then Alexander must be a knight based on Chloe saying Sofia is a knight.\n11. If Chloe is a knight, then Alexander must be a knave based on Chloe saying Sofia is a knight.\n\nFrom scenario 9, we get:\n- Alexander is a knight because he says Sofia is a knight.\n- Alexander is a knave because he says Sofia is a knight, which is consistent with Chloe being a knight from scenario 1.\n\nAll other cases lead to contradictions. Therefore, Chloe must be a knave, and Alexander must be a knight.\n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nRESULT: Chloe is a knave, Alexander is a knight.\n```",

In Noah's words: \"Logan is a knight if and only if Aiden is a knight\". Aiden commented, \"Charlotte is a knave\". Logan told you that If Logan is a knight then Noah is a knave. So who is a knight and who is a knave?.\nConclude with the final result in EXACTLY this format:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\\ \nRESULT: final_value\n```\nThe final_value should be statements separated by commas. For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nQUICK REASONING: To solve this problem, we need to use logical reasoning based on the given information about the island inhabitants. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Charlotte's Statement**: Aiden is either a knight or Noah is a knave. This gives us two possibilities:\n   - Aiden is a knight\n   - Noah is a knave\n\n2. **Noah's Statement**: Logan is a knight if and only if Aiden is a knight. This implies that if Aiden is a knight, then Logan must also be a knight, and if Aiden is a knave, then Logan must also be a knave.\n\n3. **Aiden's Statement**: If Logan is a knight, then Noah is a knave. This means Aiden cannot be a knight because he would then contradict his own statement.\n\n4. **Concluding from Noah's Statement**: Since Aiden cannot be a knight, Noah must be a knave.\n\nNow let's use these conclusions to determine the identities of the other residents:\n\n- From Noah's statement: Noah is a knave\n- From Aiden's statement: Aiden is a knave (since Noah is a knave)\n\nSo, the only remaining possibility for each resident is that they are knaves:\n\n- Charlotte: Knave\n- Noah: Knave\n- Aiden: Knave\n- Logan: Knight\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: [Charlotte, Noah, Aiden, Logan] = ['Knave', 'Knave', 'Knave', 'Knight']\n```\n\nExplained Reasoning:\n1. From Charlotte's statement, Aiden is either a knight or Noah is a knave. Since Aiden is a knave, Noah must be a knight.\n2. From Noah's statement, Logan is a knight if and only if Aiden is a knight. Since Aiden is a knave, Logan must be a knight.\n3. From Aiden's statement, if Logan is a knight, then Noah is a knave. Since Logan is a knight, Noah must be a knave.\n4. All other residents are knaves: Charlotte, Aiden, and Logan.\n\n```\n[Charlotte, Noah, Aiden, Logan] = ['Knave', 'Knave', 'Knave', 'Knight']\n```",
