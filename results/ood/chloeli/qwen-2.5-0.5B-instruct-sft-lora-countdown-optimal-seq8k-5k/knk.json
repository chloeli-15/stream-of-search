Therefore, Matthew must be a knave.\n\n2. **Matthew's Statement**: \"If Riley is a knave then Matthew is a knight\"\n   - Since Matthew is a knave, if Riley is a knave, then Matthew must also be a knave.

Amelia's statement: \"Jack is not a knight\" implies that Jack must be a knave because if he were a knight, he would contradict Amelia's claim.\n3. Olivia's statement: \"If Jack is a knave then Amelia is a knight\" can be analyzed further. Since Jack is a knave, Olivia must be a knight based on this rule.\n\nLet's analyze these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Jack's Statement\n- \"Olivia is a knave and Jack is a knight\" leads to two possibilities:\n  1. Jack is a knight, Olivia is a knave\n  2. Jack is a knave, Olivia is a knave\n\n### Step 2: Apply Amelia's Statement\n- If Jack is a knave, Jack cannot be a knight (since he would contradict Amelia's claim).\n- Therefore, Jack must be a knight.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Olivia's State Based on Amelia's Statement\n- If Jack is a knight, Olivia must be a knight because she says \"If Jack is a knave then Amelia is a knight\".\n- This means Olivia is a knight.\n\n### Conclusion\n- Jack is a knight\n- Olivia is a knight\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Jack,Knight,Olivier,Knight\n```\n",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nQUICK REASONING: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by each inhabitant based on their roles as knights or knaves. We know from the initial conditions that:\n\n1. Sofia's statement: If Sofia is a knight, then Charlotte is a knight. This means that if Sofia is a knight, both Charlotte and Scarlett must be knights.\n2. Scarlett's statement: Sofia is a knight. From this, we can deduce that both Charlotte and Scarlett must be knights.\n3. Charlotte's statement: Sofia is a knight. Since both Charlotte and Scarlett are already known to be knights, Charlotte must also be a knight.\n\nFrom these conclusions, we can conclude that Charlotte is a knight and all other individuals are knaves.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nQUESERATION: Let's analyze these statements step by step:\n\n1. **Benjamin's Statement:** \"Daniel is a knave or Grace is a knave\"\n2. **Grace's Statement:** \"Grace is a knight if and only if Daniel is a knight\" (this implies that if Daniel is a knight, Grace must also be a knight; if Daniel is a knave, Grace must not be a knave)\n3. **Ethan's Statement:** \"If Grace is a knight then Benjamin is a knight\" (this implies that if Grace is a knight, both Benjamin and Ethan must be knights)\n\nFrom Statement 3, we know that if Grace is a knight, both Benjamin and Ethan must be knights.\n\nNow let's consider Statement 1:\n- If Grace is a knight, then from Statement 3, both Benjamin and Ethan must be knights.\n- However, Statements 2 and 3 do not directly involve Benjamin, so they don't provide any new information about Benjamin's status.\n\nLet's check Statement 2:\n- From Statement 2, if Daniel is a knight, then Grace must be a knight.\n- This means Daniel cannot be a knave because if he were, Grace would have to be a knave, which contradicts Statement 1.\n\nSince all conditions lead to contradictions, it appears there might be an error in our initial assumptions. Let's re-evaluate using Statement 2 directly:\n\nFrom Statement 2, if Daniel is a knight, then Grace must be a knight. But from Statement 1, if Grace is a knight, then both Benjamin and Ethan must be knights. This creates a contradiction because both Benjamin and Ethan cannot be knights simultaneously under Statement 2.\n\nTherefore, it seems there are no valid conclusions based on the given statements.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nQUICK REASONING: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by each inhabitant and use logical reasoning to determine their identities. Let's go through these steps:\n\n1. **Grace's Statement:** \"Noah is not a knave.\"\n2. **Noah's Statement:** \"Grace is a knave and Penelope is a knight.\"\n3. **Penelope's Statement:** \"Grace is a knight if and only if Noah is a knave.\"\n\nFirst, let's consider Grace's statement:\n- Since Grace is a knight, she can either be telling the truth or lying.\n- If Grace is telling the truth, then Noah must be a knave (because all other statements would be false).\n- This means that Noah cannot be a knave, which contradicts Grace's claim.\n\nSince Grace cannot be telling the truth, she must be lying. Therefore, Noah must be a knave.\n\nNow, let's consider Noah's statement:\n- Since Noah is a knave, all other statements must be false.\n- From Noah's statement, we know that Grace is a knave because all other statements are false.\n- This means that Penelope must be a knight because she is told that Grace is a knight if and only if Noah is a knave.\n\nNext, let's consider Penelope's statement:\n- Since Penelope is a knight, she can either be telling the truth or lying.\n- From Penelope's statement, we know that Grace is a knight if and only if Noah is a knave. However, we already determined that Grace is a knave, so this statement is false.\n- This means that Noah must be a knave, which we have already established.\n\nTherefore, both Grace and Penelope are knaves, and Noah is a knight.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\[\n\\text{SOLUTION: YES} \\quad \\text{RESULT: Knight, Knave, Knight}\n\\]",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nQUICK REASONING: To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement based on the properties of knights and knaves. Let's start with Joseph's statement: \"Ava is a knight or Jack is a knave.\" If Ava is a knight, then Joseph must also be a knight because he tells the truth. This means Ava is a knight, and since Joseph is a knight, Ava must be a knight. Now let's consider Ava's statement: \"Jack is a knight or Jack is a knave.\" Since Ava is a knight, this statement is true. So, Jack must be a knave. Now let's look at Jack's statement: \"Ava is a knight and Joseph is a knight.\" Since Jack is a knave, this statement is false. Therefore, Ava must be a knight.\n\nConcluding from these steps, we have:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Jack is a knight, Ava is a knight, and Joseph is a knave\n```\nExplained:\n- From Joseph's statement, we know Ava is a knight.\n- From Ava's statement, we know Jack is a knave.\n- From Jack's statement, we know Joseph is a knave, which contradicts our previous conclusion that Jack is a knave.\n- Therefore, all statements are consistent with Jack being a knave.",

Therefore, $F1$ is true.\nExploring Step 2: From $C1$, since $F1$ is true, it follows that $T1$ is false. This means Jack is a knave, as he lies when told by others that if they're knights, then Samuel is a knave.\nExploring Step 3: From $S2$, we know that $F2$ is true because $S2$ states \"Jack is not a knave.\" Since Jack is a knave, $F2$ is true.\nExploring Step 4: From $C3$, since $F2$ is true, it follows that $T2$ is false.

If Sebastian is a knight, then all his statements must be true. This means Liam's statement \"Liam is a knave or Victoria is a knight\" is false, which contradicts Sebastian's claim that he is a knight. Therefore, Sebastian cannot be a knight.\n2. If Sebastian is a knave, then all his statements must be false. This means Liam's statement \"Sebastian is a knave or Victoria is a knave\" is true, which is consistent with Sebastian being a knave. Similarly, Victoria's statement \"Sebastian is a knight if and only if Sebastian is a knave\" is also true because both implications are from the same condition (sebastian being a knave). This matches Sebastian's description as a knave.\n\nFrom these initial conditions, we can conclude:\n- Sebastian is a knave\n- Liam is a knight\n- Victoria is a knight\n\nConcluding with:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: [Sebastian, Liam, Victoria] are all knights, [Sebastian, Victoria] are all knaves\n```",

From Grace's statement: \"Luke is a knave if and only if Luke is a knight\"\n\nLet's analyze these step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: From Aurora's Statement\n- If Aurora is a knight, then Aurora is telling the truth, so Grace must be a knave.\n\n### Step 2: From Luke's Statement\n- If Grace is not a knave, then Grace could be either a knight or a knave. Since we already know she is a knight, this leaves us with two possibilities for Grace: Knight or Knave.\n\n### Step 3: From Grace's Statement\n- If Luke is a knave, then Luke is telling the truth, so he would say that if Grace is a knave, then Luke is a knight. This directly contradicts our previous conclusion that Grace is a knight.\n\nTherefore, if Luke is a knave, it leads to a contradiction. So, Luke cannot be a knight.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining options:\n- **Case 1:** If Grace is a knave, then from Luke's statement, we have a contradiction. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n- **Case 2:** If Aurora is a knight, then from Aurora's statement, we have a valid situation where Grace is a knave (from Step 1). Now, since Grace is a knave, from Luke's statement, we can conclude that Aurora is a knave.\n\nSo, Aurora is a knave and Grace is a knave.\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Aurora: knave, Grace: knave\n```\n",

Jacob's Statement: If Jacob is a knight, then Harper is a knight. This can be written as \\( J \\rightarrow H \\), where \\( J \\) represents Jacob and \\( H \\) represents Harper.\n2. Harper's Statement: Riley is a knight or Riley is a knave. This can be written as \\( R \\rightarrow K \\), where \\( R \\) represents Riley and \\( K \\) represents either a knight or a knave.\n3. Riley's Statement: Harper is a knight if and only if Jacob is a knight. This can be written as \\( H \\rightarrow J \\), where \\( H \\) represents Harper and \\( J \\) represents Jacob.\n\nCurrent State of Knowledge:\n- \\( J \\rightarrow H \\)\n- \\( R \\rightarrow K \\)\n- \\( H \\rightarrow J \\)\n\nExploring Implications:\nFrom \\( J \\rightarrow H \\), we know that if Jacob is a knight, then Harper must also be a knight. From \\( H \\rightarrow J \\), we know that if Harper is a knight, then Jacob must also be a knight. Therefore, both Jacob and Harper must be knights.\n\nCurrent Knowledge: Both Jacob and Harper are knights.\nExploring Further Implications:\nSince both Jacob and Harper are knights, let's consider Harper's statement \\( R \\rightarrow K \\). Since Harper is a knight, \\( R \\rightarrow K \\) is always true. However, we need to check if this leads us to a contradiction. If Harper is a knight, then Riley must be a knave (since \\( R \\rightarrow K \\) implies \\( H \\rightarrow J \\) which includes all possibilities of \\( J \\) being a knight).\n\nNow, let's re-examine the initial statements with these new knowledge:\n- \\( J \\rightarrow H \\) remains true.\n- \\( R \\rightarrow K \\) still holds.\n- \\( H \\rightarrow J \\) is true for both Jacob and Harper, but this does not provide new information about Riley directly from this point.\n\nGiven the current state, let's assume Riley's statement \\( H \\rightarrow J \\) is true, which means both Jacob and Harper are knights. Since both are knights, there are no additional contradictions from this step.\n\nTherefore, after exploring all implications, we conclude:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Knight, Knave\n```\nAll initial statements have been satisfied, and it is possible that both Jacob and Harper are knights, and Riley is a knave.",

Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 3 inhabitants: Mason, Luke, and Charlotte. Mason said, \"If Mason is a knight then Charlotte is a knave.\" In a statement by Luke: \"Mason is not a knave\". \"Mason is not a knight\" - Charlotte. So who is a knight and who is a knave?.\nConclude with the final result in EXACTLY this format:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\\ \nRESULT: final_value\n```\nThe final_value should be statements separated by commas. For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nQUICK REASONING: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Mason, Luke, and Charlotte based on their roles as knights or knaves. We can use logical reasoning to determine who is a knight and who is a knave. Let's go through each step:\n\n1. **Mason's Statement**: \"If Mason is a knight then Charlotte is a knave.\"\n2. **Luke's Statement**: \"Mason is not a knave.\"\n3. **Charlotte's Statement**: \"Mason is not a knight.\"\n\nFirst, let's consider Mason's statement. Since Mason is telling the truth, if he says that if Mason is a knight then Charlotte is a knave, it must be true. This means that if Mason is a knight, then Charlotte must be a knave. If Mason is a knave, then Charlotte cannot be a knave (since she would contradict Mason's statement).\n\nNext, let's look at Luke's statement. Since Luke is lying, he cannot be a knight. Therefore, Luke must be a knave.\n\nNow, let's consider Charlotte's statement. Since Charlotte is a knave, her statement cannot be true because it directly contradicts Luke being a knave. This leaves only Mason's initial statement to be true. So, Mason must be a knight.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: [Mason, Luke, Charlotte] = [Knight, Knave, Knight]\n```\n\nThis matches our final answer of `[Mason, Luke, Charlotte] = [Knight, Knave, Knight]`.",

Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 3 inhabitants: Harper, Charlotte, and Elizabeth. In a statement by Harper: \"If Harper is a knight then Elizabeth is a knave\". \"Harper is a knave and Elizabeth is a knave\" - Charlotte. In Elizabeth's words: \"Elizabeth is a knight if and only if Harper is a knight\". So who is a knight and who is a knave?.\nConclude with the final result in EXACTLY this format:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\\ \nRESULT: final_value\n```\nThe final_value should be statements separated by commas. For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nQUICK REASONING:\nExploring initial statements:\n1. Harper: \"If Harper is a knight then Elizabeth is a knave.\" This implies that if Harper is knight, Elizabeth must be knave, and vice versa.\n2. Harper: \"Harper is a knave and Elizabeth is a knave\" - This directly contradicts the first statement because it says Harper and Elizabeth are both knaves, not just one of them being knave.\n\nConcluding from the second initial statement, we know Elizabeth is definitely a knave. Since Harper and Elizabeth are both knaves, Harper cannot be a knight according to the first initial statement.\n\nTherefore, Harper must be a knave, and Elizabeth must be a knight. Concluding this leads to:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Knight, Knave\n```",

From Riley's statement: \"Elizabeth is a knave if and only if Elizabeth is a knight\", we can conclude that Elizabeth is either a knave or a knight. This gives us 2 possibilities for Elizabeth: KKN or KKK.\n2. From Oliver's statement: \"Riley is a knave or Elizabeth is a knight\", we know that Oliver must be telling the truth because he says \"Riley is a knave or Elizabeth is a knight\". Therefore, Oliver is also a knight (since a knight always tells the truth).\n3. Since Oliver is a knight, all other statements must be false. This leaves only one possibility for Elizabeth: KKK, which means Elizabeth is a knight.\n4. Now we have two possible states for Elizabeth: KKN or KKK. We need to determine which of these is true based on Oliver's statement.\n5. If Elizabeth is KKN, then Riley's statement would be false, which contradicts Oliver's statement. Therefore, Elizabeth must be KKK.\n6. If Elizabeth is KKK, then Riley's statement would be true, which matches Oliver's statement. Therefore, Elizabeth is a knight.\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: [KKN, KKK, KKK]\n```\n",

If Liam is a knight, then Isabella must be a knave, which contradicts Statement 1. Therefore, Isabella cannot be a knave based on Statement 1.\n\nExploring Statement 2: From Statement 2, we know that if Isabella is a knight, then Liam must be a knight. If Liam is a knight, then Isabella must be a knight, which satisfies Statement 2.\n\nExploring Statement 3: From Statement 3, we know that if Isabella is a knight, then Aria must be a knave. This directly leads to Isabella being a knight because Liam would have to be a knight, and Liam would also be a knight, so Isabella must be a knight.\n\nConcluding Solution: Since Isabella is a knight from Statement 3, Liam must be a knight from Statement 2.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nQUANTIFYING:\n1. Alexander's statement: \"Ava is a knight and Riley is a knight\" leads to 2 possible conclusions: either Ava is a knight and Riley is also a knight, or both are knaves.\n2. Riley's statement: \"Ava is not a knave\" leads to 2 possible conclusions: either Ava is a knight and Riley is a knave, or both are knaves.\n3. Ava's statement: \"Ava is a knight and Riley is a knave\" leads to 2 possible conclusions: either Ava is a knight and Riley is a knave, or both are knaves.\n\nExploring these initial conditions, we can see that:\n\n- From Alexander's statement, Ava could be a knight (K) and Riley could be a knight (K), or both could be knaves (KK).\n- From Riley's statement, Ava could be a knight (K) and Riley could be a knave (KN), or both could be knaves (KK).\n- From Ava's statement, Ava could be a knight (K) and Riley could be a knave (KN), or both could be knaves (KK).\n\nCombining all these possibilities, we need to determine which of these scenarios lead to exactly one knight and one knave. Let's analyze each case:\n\n### Case 1: Ava is a knight (K) and Riley is a knight (K)\n- Ava is a knight, so her statement \"Ava is a knight and Riley is a knight\" is true.\n- Riley is also a knight, so his statement \"Ava is not a knave\" is false, which is consistent with our current situation.\n- This scenario results in 3 people: K, K, K.\n\n### Case 2: Ava is a knight (K) and Riley is a knave (KN)\n- Ava is a knight, so her statement \"Ava is a knight and Riley is a knight\" is true.\n- Riley is a knave, so his statement \"Ava is not a knave\" is false, which is consistent with our current situation.\n- This scenario results in 3 people: K, KN, K.\n\n### Case 3: Ava is a knave (KN) and Riley is a knight (K)\n- Ava is a knave, so her statement \"Ava is a knight and Riley is a knight\" is false, which is inconsistent with our current situation.\n- This scenario results in 3 people: K, K, KN.\n\n### Case 4: Ava is a knave (KN) and Riley is a knave (KN)\n- Both are knaves, so their statements are false, which is consistent with our current situation.\n- This scenario results in 3 people: K, K, K.\n\nFrom these cases, only Case 4 results in exactly one knight and one knave.

This can be interpreted as:\n- If Scarlett is a knight, then Avery must be telling the truth (Scarlett is a knight).\n- If Scarlett is a knave, then Avery must be lying (Scarlett is a knave).\n\nSo, from Avery's statement, we have:\n- If Scarlett is a knight, Avery is telling the truth.\n- If Scarlett is a knave, Avery is lying.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Oliver's Statement\nOliver says that Avery is a knave and Scarlett is a knight. From this, we know:\n- Avery is a knave (from Avery's statement)\n- Scarlett is a knight (from Avery's statement)\n\nThis leads us to conclude that Avery is indeed a knave, and Scarlett is a knight.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Scarlett's Statement\nScarlett says that Oliver is a knave and Scarlett is a knight. From this, we know:\n- Oliver is a knave (from Oliver's statement)\n- Scarlett is a knight (from Avery's statement)\n\nThis leads us to conclude that Avery is not a knight because Avery is a knave, and Scarlett is a knight.\n\nTherefore, Avery is a knave, and Scarlett is a knight.\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Avery is a knave, Scarlett is a knight\n```\n",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nQUICK REASONING: Exploring initial conditions, we know that all 3 inhabitants must either both be knights or both be knaves. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Riley says:** If Riley is a knight, then Emily is a knight.\n2. **Owen says:** \"Emily is a knight.\"\n3. **Emily says:** \"Emily is a knight if and only if Riley is a knight.\"\n\nFrom Statement 3, we can infer that Emily is a knight because if Riley were a knave, Emily would not be a knight (as stated in Statement 1). Therefore, all three statements involving Emily being a knight lead to the same conclusion.\n\nSince all three statements involve Emily as a knight, it follows that Emily is indeed a knight.\n\nNow let's move on to Statements 1 and 2:\n- From Statement 1, if Riley is a knight, then Emily is also a knight.\n- From Statement 2, Owen states that Emily is a knight, which is consistent with Statement 1 since Emily is already confirmed to be a knight from Statement 1.\n\nThis confirms that Emily is a knight, and all other statements involving Emily are consistent with this conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Emily is a knight\n```\n",

James remarked, \"If Mia is a knight then James is a knight\". Logan stated, \"If James is a knave then Mia is a knight\". Mia remarked, \"Owen is a knight if and only if Logan is a knave\".

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nQUICK REASONING: To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement using the given rules of knights and knaves. Let's go through them step-by-step:\n\n1. **Owen's Statement:** \"Logan is a knave if and only if James is a knight.\"\n2. **James's Statement:** \"If Mia is a knight then James is a knight.\"\n3. **Logan's Statement:** \"If James is a knave then Mia is a knight.\"\n4. **Mia's Statement:** \"Owen is a knight if and only if Logan is a knave.\"\n\nFirst, let's assume all statements are true, which means all people are either knights or knaves. We will use logical reasoning to deduce who is who.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Initial Assumption: All Statements True\nAll initial statements are true, so let's explore further.\n\n#### Analyzing Owen's Statement\nOwen says: \"Logan is a knave if and only if James is a knight.\" This can be rephrased as:\n\\[ \\text{Logan is a knave} \\iff \\text{James is a knight} \\]\nSince both John and Jane are knaves, these statements cannot both be true simultaneously.\n\n#### Exploring Further Implications\nFrom Owen\u2019s statement, we know that if Logan is a knave, then James must be a knight. But this creates a contradiction because both John and Jane are knaves. Therefore, this assumption is false.\n\n### Conclusion from Initial Assumptions\nAfter assuming all statements are true, we find that it leads to a contradiction. Thus, at least one of these statements must be false.\n\n#### Analyzing James's Statement\nJames states: \"If Mia is a knight then James is a knight.\" This can be rephrased as:\n\\[ \\text{Mia is a knight} \\iff \\text{James is a knight} \\]\nThis implies that if Mia is a knight, then James must also be a knight. However, this directly contradicts Owen's initial statement that Logan is a knave if and only if James is a knight.\n\n#### Exploring Further Implications\nFrom James's statement, we know that if Mia is a knight, then James must be a knight. This is consistent with Owen's initial statement but not with James's current statement. This suggests that Mia could be a knight, which would lead to a valid scenario where both John and Jane are knaves, which is allowed by Owen's statement.\n\n#### Analyzing Logan's Statement\nLogan states: \"If James is a knave then Mia is a knight.\" This can be rephrased as:\n\\[ \\text{James is a knave} \\iff \\text{Mia is a knight} \\]\nAgain, this implies that if James is a knave, then Mia must be a knight. This directly contradicts Owen's initial statement that Logan is a knave if and only if James is a knight.\n\n#### Exploring Further Implications\nFrom Logan's statement, we know that if James is a knave, then Mia must be a knight. This is consistent with James's current statement, which confirms that Mia is indeed a knight.\n\n#### Final Analysis\nBased on the analysis above, we conclude that Mia is the only person who satisfies all conditions:\n- Mia is a knight.\n- John is a knave (since Mia is a knight).\n- Jane is a knave (since John is a knave).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Mia, John, Jane are knaves, John is a knight\n```\n",

David's statement: \"David is a knight or Liam is a knight\" also leads to two cases: David is a knight, or Liam is a knave. Since Liam is a knave, David must be a knight. This confirms that Liam is a knight.\n3. Emily's statement: \"Liam is a knight if and only if Owen is a knave\" follows directly from David's previous statement.

As Victoria put it, \"Victoria is a knight if and only if Zoey is a knight\". \"If Abigail is a knave then Victoria is a knave,\" Lily claimed.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nQUICK REASONING: To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement based on the properties of knights and knaves. Let's go through them step-by-step:\n\n1. **Victoria's Statement**: \"Victoria is a knight if and only if Zoey is a knight\" (KJK)\n2. **Lily's Statement**: \"If Abigail is a knave then Victoria is a knave\" (AKV)\n3. **Abigail's Statement**: \"If Zoey is a knight then Lily is a knight\" (ZKL)\n4. **Zoey's Statement**: \"Abigail is a knave\" (AK)\n\nFirst, let's analyze Victoria's statement KJK. Since KJK is true, both Victoria and Zoey must be knights.\n\nNext, let's consider Lily's statement AKV. This means if Abigail is a knave, then Victoria is also a knave. Since Victoria is already a knight, this cannot be true. Therefore, Abigail must be a knave.\n\nNow, let's consider Abigail's statement ZKL. If Abigail is a knave, then ZKL must be false. This means Zoey must be a knight. So, Zoey is a knight.\n\nSince Zoey is a knight, Victoria must be a knave. From Victoria being a knave, Lily must be a knight because her statement AVK is true (since Abigail is a knave).\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Knight, Knave\n```\n",

Therefore, all her initial statements must be true.\n\n#### Case 1: Sofia says \"Abigail is a knave or William is a knight\"\n- If Sofia says \"Abigail is a knave\", then Abigail must be a knave (since she is a knight).\n- If Sofia says \"William is a knight\", then William must be a knight (since he is a knave).\n\nThis leads to a contradiction because both conditions cannot be true simultaneously.\n\n#### Case 2: Sofia says \"Abigail is a knave\"\n- Since Sofia is a knight, this statement is false.\n- From Sofia's first statement: Abigail is not a knave, so Abigail must be a knight.\n- From Sofia's second statement: William is a knight, so William must be a knight.\n\nBoth cases lead to consistent results, so we need to re-evaluate our approach.\n\n### Step 2: Revisiting Sofia's Statement\nGiven Sofia's statement, we have two possible scenarios for her actions:\n1. \"Abigail is a knave or William is a knight\"\n2. \"Abigail is a knave\"\n\nLet's consider each scenario separately:\n\n#### Scenario 1: \"Abigail is a knave or William is a knight\"\n- If \"Abigail is a knave\", then William must be a knight.\n- If \"Abigail is a knave\", then William must be a knight, which contradicts the previous conclusion.\n\nSo, this scenario is impossible.\n\n#### Scenario 2: \"Abigail is a knave\"\n- From Sofia's second statement, \"William is a knight\", it follows that William is a knight.\n- From Sofia's first statement, \"Abigail is a knave\", it follows that Abigail must be a knave.\n\nThis scenario is consistent with all initial conditions.\n\nTherefore, **Sofia is a knave** and **Abigail is a knave**.\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Sofia is a knave, Abigail is a knave\n```\n",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nassistant\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.\n```\nCurrent State: [Michael, Zoey, Ethan] from Logans statement, [Zoey, Ethan] from Isabellas statement, [Michael, Zoey] from Olivers statement, [Zoey, Michael] from Victorias statement, [Isabell, Ethan] from Logan\u2019s statement\nExploring Possible Situations:\n1. If Michael is a knight, then Zoey must be a knave (from Logan\u2019s statement). This leads to [Zoey, Ethan] = [Zoey, Ethan], which is consistent.\n2. If Zoey is a knave, then Victoria must be a knight (from Olivers statement), which contradicts Logan\u2019s statement since Logan would say Victoria is a knave, not a knight. This is a contradiction.\n3. If Ethan is a knight, then Logan must be a knave (from Logan\u2019s statement). This also leads to [Zoey, Ethan] = [Zoey, Ethan], which is consistent.\n4. If Ethan is a knave, then Victoria must be a knight (from Olivers statement), which contradicts Logan\u2019s statement since Logan would say Victoria is a knave, not a knight. This is another contradiction.\n\nFrom the contradictions, we can conclude that either Ethan is a knight or Victoria is a knight, but not both. Let's explore these possibilities:\n\n5. If Victoria is a knight, then Logan must be a knave (from Logan\u2019s statement). This is possible, as we have [Zoey, Ethan] = [Zoey, Ethan].\n6. If Victoria is a knave, then Logan must be a knight (from Logan\u2019s statement). This is also possible, as we have [Zoey, Ethan] = [Zoey, Ethan].\n\nSince both scenarios lead to the same conclusion, Victoria being a knight or a knave does not provide new information. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Victoria is a knight, and either Michael or Zoey is a knave.\n```",

Let K_A = K_A, N_A = N_A, T_A = T_A, L_A = L_A, K_V = K_V, N_V = N_V, T_V = T_V, L_V = L_V.\n2. Victoria says: Aria is a knight and Victoria is a knight.

This gives us: K_V = T_V, L_V = T_V, K_A = T_A, N_A = L_A, T_A = T_A, L_A = L_A.\nFrom Victoria's statement: Aria is a knight and Victoria is a knight. This gives us: K_V = T_V, L_V = T_V, K_A = T_A, N_A = L_A, T_A = T_A, L_A = L_A.\nSince K_V = T_V, we have: K_A = T_A, N_A = L_A.\nFrom Ava's statement: Victoria is a knave and Aria is a knight. This gives us: K_V = T_V, L_V = T_V, K_A = T_A, N_A = L_A, T_A = T_A, L_A = L_A.\nSince K_V = T_V, we have: K_A = T_A, N_A = L_A.\nFrom Lucas's statement: Victoria is a knight and Aria is a knight. This gives us: K_V = T_V, L_V = T_V, K_A = T_A, N_A = L_A, T_A = T_A, L_A = L_A.\nSince K_V = T_V, we have: K_A = T_A, N_A = L_A, L_A = L_A.\nConclusion:\nAll inhabitants are either Knights (K) or Knaves (N), with no contradictions.\n\n```\n```\n",

Let's go through them step-by-step:\n\n1. **Harper's Statement:** \"Grace is a knave and William is a knave\"\n   - Since Grace is a knave, her statement must be false.\n   - Since William is a knave, his statement must also be false.\n\n2. **Chloe's Statement:** \"Harper is a knave or William is a knight\"\n   - From Harper's statement, we know Harper is a knave (false).\n   - From Chloe's statement, since Harper is a knave, Harper cannot be a knight (true), so William must be a knight (true).\n\n3. **Grace's Statement:** \"Chloe is not a knight\"\n   - From Chloe's statement, we know William is a knight (true).\n   - From Grace's statement, since William is a knight, Chloe must be a knight (true).\n   - This creates a contradiction because we have two conflicting statements about Chloe being a knight or a knave.\n\nSince both Chloe and Grace's statements lead to contradictions, there must be an error in our initial assumption. Let's re-evaluate using logical reasoning:\n\n- If William is a knight, then Harper must be a knave (from Harper's statement).\n- If William is a knight, then Chloe must be a knight (from Chloe's statement).\n- This leads to a consistent scenario where all statements are true under these conditions.\n\nTherefore, all statements are correct based on the given initial information.

Analyze the statement from Michael: \"Benjamin is a knight.\"\n3. Analyze the statement from Amelia: \"Benjamin is a knave if and only if Michael is a knave.\"\n\nGiven these initial pieces of information, let's explore possible scenarios:\n\n### Scenario 1: All are knights\n- If all are knights, then all statements are true. This means:\n  - Benjamin is a knight (from Benjamin's statement)\n  - Amelia is a knight (from Amelia's statement)\n  - Joseph is a knight (from Joseph's statement)\n\nAll conditions are satisfied, so all are knights.\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: [All are knights]\n```\n\n### Scenario 2: Some are knights, some are knaves\n- If not all are knights, then at least one is a knave.\n- From Benjamin's statement, if Joseph is a knave, then Amelia must be a knight.\n- From Michael's statement, if Benjamin is a knight, then Michael must be a knave.\n- From Amelia's statement, if Benjamin is a knave, then Michael must be a knave.\n\nThis leads to:\n- Michael is a knave (since he must be a knave if both Benjamin and Joseph are knaves).\n- Joseph is a knight (since he can't be a knave if all are knights).\n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nRESULT: [Joseph is a knight, Michael is a knave]\n```\n\nThus, the final answer

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nQUANTITY: 3\nExploring Statements:\n1. From Sofia's statement: \"David is a knight or Sofia is a knight\"\n2. From Abigail's statement: \"Abigail is a knight or Sofia is a knight\"\n3. From Daniel's statement: \"If David is a knave, then Abigail is a knight\"\n4. From David's statement: \"Daniel is a knave\"\n\nLet's analyze these statements step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing Sofia's Statement\nSofia says: \"David is a knight or Sofia is a knight\"\nThis can be rewritten as: \\(D \\lor S\\) where \\(D\\) represents David and \\(S\\) represents Sofia.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing Abigail's Statement\nAbigail says: \"Abigail is a knight or Sofia is a knight\"\nThis can be rewritten as: \\(A \\lor S\\) where \\(A\\) represents Abigail and \\(S\\) represents Sofia.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Daniel's Statement\nDaniel states: \"If David is a knave, then Abigail is a knight\"\nSince David is a knave (\\(\\lnot D\\)), for Daniel's statement to be true, Abigail must be a knight (\\(A = K\\)).\n\n### Step 4: Using Daniel's Conclusion\nGiven \\(A = K\\), Daniel's conclusion \\(A = K\\) is true.\nThis means David is a knave (\\(\\lnot D\\)) because Daniel states David is a knave.\n\nNow, let's use this information to determine who is a knight and who is a knave from the other statements:\n\nFrom Sofia's statement: \\(D \\lor S\\)\nSince \\(S = K\\) (David is a knave), we have: \\(D \\lor K\\)\n\nFrom Abigail's statement: \\(A \\lor S\\)\nSince \\(A = K\\) (David is a knave), we have: \\(K \\lor S\\)\n\nCombining these results, we get: \\(K \\lor K\\) which simplifies to \\(K\\).\n\nSo, both David and Sofia are knaves, and only David is a knight.\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: K,D\n```\n",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nQUICK REASONING: To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement given by the inhabitants of the island using the rules of knights and knaves. Let's go through them step-by-step:\n\n1. **William's Statement**: \"If William is a knight then Penelope is a knave.\"\n   - If William is a knight, then his statement is true. If William is a knave, then his statement is false.\n   - Since William is a knight, his statement must be true. This means Penelope is a knave.\n\n2. **Oliver's Statement**: \"William is a knave if and only if Penelope is a knave.\"\n   - This statement implies that if William is a knave, then Penelope must also be a knave. Conversely, if Penelope is a knave, then William must also be a knave.\n   - Given that William is a knave, it follows that Penelope must be a knave.\n\n3. **Victoria's Statement**: \"William is a knave and Penelope is a knave.\"\n   - This statement directly contradicts what Oliver stated initially. It cannot both be true (William is a knave) and true (Penelope is a knave), so it must be false.\n\n4. **Penelope's Statement**: \"Penelope is a knight.\"\n   - From Oliver's statement, we know William is a knave. From Victoria's statement, we know William is a knave, so Victoria must be a knave.\n   - From Oliver's statement, we know William is a knave, so Oliver must be a knave.\n   - Therefore, all four statements agree on Penelope being a knight.\n\nSo, the solution is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: William is a knight, Oliver is a knight, Victoria is a knave, Penelope is a knight.\n```\n",

From Noah's statement, we know Harper must be a knave because he says Harper is a knave.\n2. From Chloe's statement, we know Harper cannot be a knave (since she says Harper is a knight), so Harper must be a knave.\n3. From Harper's statement, we know Noah is a knave because he says Noah is a knight, which is true.\n4. From Scarlett's statement, we know Chloe must be a knight because she says Harper is a knight, which is false.\n5.

Therefore, Aria must be a knave.\nStep 4: From Statement 4, since Avery is a knave, his statement must be false. This means Harper's statement must also be false.\nStep 5: From Statement 5, since Avery is a knave, he cannot be a knight (since a knight always tells the truth) and he cannot be a knave (since a knave always lies).

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nQUANTIFYING:\n1. Alexander's statement: 20% of people are knights, 80% are knaves. Let's assume there are \\( K \\) knights and \\( N \\) knaves initially.\n2. Evelyn's statement: 50% of people are knights, 50% are knaves. Let's assume there are \\( K \\) knights and \\( N \\) knaves initially.\n3. Jackson's statement: 75% of people are knights, 25% are knaves. Let's assume there are \\( K \\) knights and \\( N \\) knaves initially.\n4. Scarlett's statement: If Evelyn is a knight, then Jackson is a knight; if Evelyn is a knave, then Jackson is a knave. This implies that if \\( E \\) is a knight, \\( J \\) must be a knight, and if \\( E \\) is a knave, \\( J \\) must be a knave.\n\nLet's analyze each statement step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Alexander's Statement\n\\[ S_A = 20\\% = 0.20 \\]\n\\[ C_A = 80\\% = 0.80 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Evelyn's Statement\n\\[ S_E = 50\\% = 0.50 \\]\n\\[ C_E = 50\\% = 0.50 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Jackson's Statement\n\\[ S_J = 75\\% = 0.75 \\]\n\\[ C_J = 25\\% = 0.25 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Scarlett's Statement\nAssume \\( E \\) is a knight (from \\( S_E \\)) and \\( J \\) is a knight (from \\( S_J \\)). Then, from \\( C_J \\), we have \\( J \\) as a knight. From \\( C_A \\), since \\( J \\) is a knight, all other people must be knaves. Therefore, \\( K \\) is a knight and \\( N \\) are knaves.\n\nNow let's verify if these conditions hold:\n- All 4 people are either knights or knaves.\n- Only 2 of them are knights, so \\( K = 2 \\).\n- All 4 are either knights or knaves, so \\( N = 2 \\).\n\nThis satisfies all initial conditions.\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: 2, 2, 2, 2\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nQUANTIFYING:\n1.

Conclude with the final result: ```\nCurrent State: 30% chance of being a knight, 70% chance of being a knave\nExploring Statement #1: Charlotte's statement: \"Charlotte is a knight or Sofia is a knight\"\nPossible scenarios:\n- Charlotte is a knight: This leads to \"Sofia is a knight\" as a consequence, which contradicts Charlotte's initial claim.\n- Charlotte is a knave: This leaves \"Sofia is a knave\" as a possibility, consistent with Charlotte's initial claim.\n\nExploring Statement #2: Sofia's statement: \"Alexander is not a knave\"\nThis statement directly relates to whether Alexander is a knight or a knave. If Alexander is a knight, then Sofia must be a knave (contradiction), so Alexander must be a knave.\n\nExploring Statement #3: Liam's statement: \"Charlotte is a knight\"\nSince we know that Alexander is a knave, Charlotte cannot be a knight. Therefore, Charlotte must be a knave.\n\nConcluding Statements:\n- Charlotte is a knave\n- Sofia is a knave\n```\nCurrent State: 50% chance of being a knight, 50% chance of being a knave\nExploring Statement #1: Charlotte is a knight\nResulting State: 80% knight, 20% knave\n```\n```\nCurrent State: 80% knight, 20% knave\nExploring Statement #2: Sofia is a knave\nResulting State: 60% knight, 40% knave\n```\n```\nCurrent State: 60% knight, 40% knave\nExploring Statement #3: Liam is a knave\nResulting State: 60% knight, 40% knave\n```\n```\nCurrent State: 60% knight, 40% knave\n```\n```\nAll States Equally Likely: 100%\n```\n```\n```\n```\n",

Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 4 inhabitants: Riley, Amelia, Harper, and Benjamin. \"Harper is not a knave,\" Riley declared. Amelia remarked, \"If Amelia is a knight then Benjamin is a knight\". In Harper's words: \"Harper is a knight and Riley is a knight\". Benjamin asserted: \"Riley is a knight\". So who is a knight and who is a knave?.\nConclude with the final result in EXACTLY this format:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\\ \nRESULT: final_value\n```\nThe final_value should be statements separated by commas. For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nQUICK REASONING: To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement using the rules of knights and knaves. Let's go through them step by step:\n\n1. **Harper is not a knave:** This means either Harper is a knight or she is a knave. If Harper is a knave, her statement \"Harper is a knight\" would be false, which contradicts the initial condition. Therefore, Harper must be a knight.\n\n2. **Amelia's statement: \"If Amelia is a knight then Benjamin is a knight.\"** Since we know Harper is a knight, if Amelia were a knight, then Benjamin would also have to be a knight (since both would follow the same rule). However, Amelia says that Benjamin is a knight, so this statement must be true. This confirms that Amelia is a knight.\n\n3. **Harper's statement: \"Harper is a knight and Riley is a knight.\"** Since we know Harper is a knight, the only possibility left for Riley is a knave. If Riley were a knight, then Riley would be telling the truth, which is consistent with the initial condition. Therefore, Riley must be a knave.\n\n4. **Benjamin's statement: \"Riley is a knight.\"** Since we know Riley is a knave, Benjamin must be a knave. This is because if Benjamin were a knight, his statement would be false, which contradicts the initial condition.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: [Riley, Amelia, Benjamin, Knave]\n```\n",

Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Aurora's Statement**: \"Riley is not a knight\" (True)\n2. **Ameria's Statement**: \"Amelia is a knight if and only if Ava is a knave\" (False)\n3. **Riley's Statement**: \"Ava is not a knight\" (True)\n4. **Ava's Statement**: \"If Amelia is a knight then Amelia is a knave\" (False)\n\nFrom Statement 3, we know that if Amelia is a knight, then Ava must be a knave. From Statement 4, we know that if Amelia is a knight, then Ava is a knave.\n\nSince Amelia is a knight, from Statement 3, we can conclude that Ava must be a knave.\n\nNow let's verify this conclusion with Statement 1:\n- If Ava is a knave, then from Statement 4, Ava cannot be a knight.\n- This contradicts Statement 1, which states that Riley is not a knight.\n\nTherefore, Ava must be a knave, and since we have established that Ava is a knave, all other statements must also be false.\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: [Aurora is a knave, Amelia is a knave, Riley is a knave, Ava is a knave]\n```\n",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nQUESERATION: Let's analyze the statements step by step to determine who is a knight and who is a knave.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Matthew's Statement\n\\[ \\text{Oliver is a knave or Joseph is a knave} \\]\nIf Oliver is a knave, then Joseph must be a knight because knights always tell the truth. If Joseph is a knight, then Matthew must be a knave (because knights always tell the truth). This gives us one possible scenario:\n\\[ \\text{Oliver is a knave, Joseph is a knight} \\]\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Oliver's Statement\n\\[ \\text{Joseph is a knight or Benjamin is a knight} \\]\nIf Joseph is a knight, then Benjamin must also be a knight. If Benjamin is a knight, then Matthew must be a knave. This gives us another possible scenario:\n\\[ \\text{Joseph is a knight, Benjamin is a knight} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Joseph's Statement\n\\[ \\text{Oliver is a knave if and only if Matthew is a knight} \\]\nThis statement implies that if Oliver is a knave, then Matthew must be a knight, and vice versa. Let's consider these scenarios again:\n\nFrom Matthew's statement, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Oliver is a knave or Joseph is a knave} \\]\nFrom Oliver's statement, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Joseph is a knight or Benjamin is a knight} \\]\nFrom Joseph's statement, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Oliver is a knave if and only if Matthew is a knight} \\]\n\nLet's combine these results:\n- If Oliver is a knave, then Joseph must be a knight, and Matthew must be a knave.\n- If Joseph is a knight, then Benjamin must be a knight, and Matthew must be a knight.\n\n### Conclusion:\nFrom the analysis, we can see that both scenarios are possible:\n1. **Scenario 1:** \\( \\text{Oliver is a knave, Joseph is a knight, Benjamin is a knight} \\)\n2. **Scenario 2:** \\( \\text{Oliver is a knave, Joseph is a knight, Benjamin is a knight, Matthew is a knight} \\)\n\nBoth scenarios are consistent with the given statements. Therefore, there are two possible configurations:\n1. Matthew, Oliver, Joseph, and Benjamin are all knights.\n2. Matthew, Oliver, Joseph, and Benjamin are all knaves.\n\nSince the problem asks for a specific answer, let's assume the most straightforward interpretation of the initial statements, which leads to the first configuration:\n\\[ \\text{Matthew, Oliver, Joseph, and Benjamin are all knights} \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Matthew, Oliver, Joseph, and Benjamin are all knights\n```\n",

This means Benjamin is a knight, which contradicts Benjamin being a knave from Isabella's statement.\n- Therefore, Emily cannot be a knave.\n\nScenario 2: If Emily is not a knave, then Benjamin is not a knave\n- From Elizabeth's statement, if Emily is not a knave, then Benjamin must be a knave. This means Benjamin is a knave, which agrees with Benjamin being a knave from Isabella's statement.\n- From Benjamin's statement, if Elizabeth is a knave, then Benjamin is a knight. This is consistent with Benjamin being a knave from Scenario 1.\n- From Benjamin's statement, if Benjamin is a knight, then Elizabeth is a knight. This is consistent with Benjamin being a knave from Scenario 1.\n\nNow, let's consider Benjamin's statement again after Scenario 2:\n```\nIsabella: Benjamin is a knave, Elizabeth is a knave\nEmily: Benjamin is a knight or Elizabeth is a knight\nBenjamin: Elizabeth is a knave, Benjamin is a knight\n```\nFrom Emily's statement, if Benjamin is a knight, then Elizabeth is a knight.
