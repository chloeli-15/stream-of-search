Hi! You'll be playing the countdown game using search strategies. In the Countdown game, we start with a set of four initial numbers (e.g., [1,2,4,5]) and a target value (e.g., 14). Our goal is to use arithmetic operations (+,-,*,/) to produce the target using all of the numbers. 

We formalize this game as a search problem:
- States: Sets of remaining numbers
- Initial State: Set of initial numbers
- Goal State: Using all numbers to reach target value
- Actions: Choose two numbers, apply an operation (+, -, *, /), replace them with the result
Constraints:
- All 4 numbers must be used exactly once

I'd like you to generate detailed reasoning traces for this game that: 
1. Uses depth first search with a heuristic. Propose a heuristic you think is promising and explain why 
2. Go through the full search trajectory in a structured manner towards the target using that strategy, with articulated thought processes 
3. Includes suboptimal trajectories (encouraged) and make explicit where you need to backtrack to a previously visited node. Brevity is not important here, rather it would be great if you can write out your entire search trajectory in a structured manner.
4. Conclude with the final result in EXACTLY this format:
```
SOLUTION: YES/NO
OPERATIONS: [list of operations performed]
RESULT: final_value
```

For example, a successful solution might end with:
```
SOLUTION: YES
OPERATIONS: ['75-72=3', '3*2=6', '66/6=11']
RESULT: 11
```
Note that each string in the list of OPERATIONS involves only 1 operation each. For example, 'A+B=C' is allowed, 'A+B/C=D' is not allowed because that involves 2 operations in the string.

An unsuccessful attempt might end with:
```
SOLUTION: NO
OPERATIONS: []
RESULT: None
```

Could you provide a detailed reasoning trace for making 75 using the numbers [55, 22, 30]? 
When you have reached a solution during the search that arrives at the target, please double check if the operations
1. use all the initial numbers once, 
2. used any numbers not in the list at all,
3. applied the arithmetics correctly. 
Otherwise, reflect on all mistakes and repeat the search process. 
Once you've reached the target and the result passes your check, report the final answer in the format given. The evaluation code will specifically look for these exact keywords and format in the final lines to extract the solution details.

Below is the complete reasoning process that I used—a depth-first search that evaluates possible operations on pairs of numbers, guided by a simple heuristic. In this case the heuristic I chose is to measure the “closeness” of an intermediate result to the target (75) by using the absolute difference |result − target|. (This is promising because when a new number is produced that is very near 75, the hope is that eventually adding the remaining number(s) can exactly reach 75.) Bear in mind that because this is a depth-first search, we may sometimes follow a path that appears “good” (or even “very promising”) and later must backtrack when we see that we cannot incorporate all numbers correctly. I will now walk through the process step by step.

────────────────────────────
Step 1. Initial state:
Numbers: {55, 22, 30}  
Target: 75

I label the numbers as they appear in the initial state. Our rules say that in each step we pick two numbers from the set, apply one of the allowed operations (+, −, *, /), and then replace the pair by the result. (Division is allowed only if it divides evenly, as is typical in Countdown.) 

────────────────────────────
Step 2. Consider possible pairs (first branch chosen: (55, 22)):

A. Pair: (55, 22)
   Try each possible legal operation:

   1. 55 + 22 = 77  
      → New state: {77, 30}  
      Heuristic evaluation: |77 – 75| = 2 (quite close)

         Now, from state {77, 30}, pick (77, 30):
         • 77 – 30 = 47  (|47 – 75| = 28)  
         • 30 – 77 = -47 (absolute value 47, not ideal)  
         • 77 + 30 = 107 (diff = 32)  
         • 77 * 30 = 2310 (diff = 2235)  
         • 77/30 is not an integer, and 30/77 is not an integer.

         None of these operations gives 75, and none (after further search) would allow the use of the two numbers to combine to exactly 75 according to our rules.  
         → BACKTRACK from state {77, 30}.

   2. 55 – 22 = 33  
      → New state: {33, 30}  
      Heuristic: |33 – 75| = 42  
         Now from {33, 30}:
         • 33 + 30 = 63   (|63 – 75| = 12)  
         • 33 – 30 = 3    (|3 – 75| = 72)  
         • 30 – 33 = -3   (| -3 – 75| = 78)  
         • 33 * 30 = 990  (|990 – 75| = 915)  
         • 33/30 and 30/33 are not admissible as they do not yield integers.
         None reach 75.
         → BACKTRACK.

   3. 22 – 55 = -33  
      → New state: {-33, 30}  
      This leads to a negative number and the values move farther from 75.  
         • -33 + 30 = -3  (| -3 – 75| = 78)  
         • -33 – 30 = -63 (| -63 – 75| = 138)  
         • Other operations produce even less promising results.
         → BACKTRACK.

   4. 55 * 22 = 1210  
      → New state: {1210, 30}  
      Heuristic: |1210 – 75| = 1135 (very far from target)  
         The next combination (with 1210 and 30) would likely be:
         • 1210 + 30 = 1240  
         • 1210 – 30 = 1180  
         • 1210 * 30 = 36300  
         • 1210/30, if integer, is 40.333… (not allowed)  
         • 30/1210 is not an integer.
         None gives 75.
         → BACKTRACK.

   5. 55/22 is not allowed because 55/22 = 2.5 (non-integer)  
   6. 22/55 is similarly not allowed.
      
   Conclusion from pair (55, 22): None of the explored operations from this pair ultimately lead to a solution that reaches 75 using all numbers.
      
────────────────────────────
Step 3. Next, explore a different pair: (55, 30)

B. Pair: (55, 30)
   Try possible operations:

   1. 55 + 30 = 85  
      → New state: {85, 22}  
      Heuristic: |85 – 75| = 10  
         From state {85, 22}:
         • 85 – 22 = 63  (|63 – 75| = 12)  
         • 22 – 85 = -63 (| -63 – 75| = 138)  
         • 85 + 22 = 107  (|107 – 75| = 32)  
         • 85 * 22 = 1870 (|1870 – 75| = 1795)  
         • 85/22 is not an integer, and 22/85 is not allowed.
         No operation gives 75.
         → BACKTRACK.

   2. 55 – 30 = 25  
      → New state: {25, 22}  
      Heuristic: |25 – 75| = 50  
         From {25, 22}:
         • 25 + 22 = 47    (|47 – 75| = 28)  
         • 25 – 22 = 3     (|3 – 75| = 72)  
         • 22 – 25 = -3    (| -3 – 75| = 78)  
         • 25 * 22 = 550   (|550 – 75| = 475)  
         • 25/22 and 22/25 are not integers.
         None give 75.
         → BACKTRACK.

   3. 55 * 30 = 1650  
      → New state: {1650, 22}  
      Heuristic: |1650 – 75| = 1575 (the result is far from 75, but note that sometimes multiplying first and then dividing can “cancel out” to yield the target).  
         Now consider combining 1650 with 22:
         Check: 1650 / 22 = 75 exactly  
         (Note: 22 goes evenly into 1650 since 22 * 75 = 1650.)  
         This gives precisely the target.
         
         At this point we have obtained a solution:
         Operation 1: 55 * 30 = 1650  
         Operation 2: 1650 / 22 = 75  
         This sequence uses all initial numbers exactly once.
      
   4. 55/30 and 30/55 are not allowed because 55/30 is non-integer and similarly for 30/55.

Since option 3 from the pair (55, 30) produces the target value, our search along this branch has been successful.

────────────────────────────
Step 4. For completeness, one could also check the pair (22, 30), but since we have already found a valid solution, we note:
- Pair (22, 30) would generate numbers such as 22 + 30 = 52 or 22 * 30 = 660, and subsequent combinations with 55 do not lead to 75.

────────────────────────────
Final Check:
1. All initial numbers [55, 22, 30] are used exactly once because in the first operation we used 55 and 30, and then we used 22 in the second operation.
2. No extraneous numbers were introduced.
3. Arithmetic rules have been properly observed (multiplication and the exact division).

────────────────────────────
Final Answer (reporting in the exact required format):

SOLUTION: YES  
OPERATIONS: ['55*30=1650', '1650/22=75']  
RESULT: 75<|im_end|>

Below is a detailed reasoning trace using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach that incorporates a simple heuristic. In our case, the heuristic is the absolute difference between the intermediate result (when we have only one number left) and the target value 27. The intuition behind this heuristic is that when there is only one number remaining (after having combined two numbers to form a new value), a smaller absolute difference to 27 indicates we are “closer” to the goal. (Note that when more than one number is present the heuristic is less directly applicable, but we still keep track of the candidates in a FIFO fashion with improvements when promising cases show up.)

─────────────────────────────  
Step 1: Define the Problem  
─────────────────────────────  
• Initial Numbers: [11, 18, 20]  
• Target Value: 27  
• Allowed Operations: +, −, *, /  
• Action: Pick any two numbers, perform an operation, and replace them with the resulting value.  
• Constraint: All initial numbers must be used once.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 2: Set Up the Search  
─────────────────────────────  
We start with the state [11, 18, 20]. Our search tree is built level-by-level by combining pairs.

Heuristic: When a new state with only 2 numbers is reached, we know that one more operation will yield the final candidate. At that point, we compute the candidate final result and use |final_candidate − 27| as a measure. Our BFS will first expand nodes in the order they are generated but will note promising nodes (i.e. those with a heuristic value of 0 or small difference) for early termination.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 3: Expand the Initial Node  
─────────────────────────────  
State A: [11, 18, 20]

From state [11,18,20] we consider every pair and every applicable operation:

• Combining 11 and 18:  
  - 11 + 18 = 29, produces state: [29, 20]  
    → Heuristic (when combined): possible final result from next operation will be checked later.  
  - 11 − 18 = -7, produces state: [-7, 20]  
  - 18 − 11 = 7, produces state: [7, 20]  
  - 11 * 18 = 198, produces state: [198, 20]  
  - Division operations: 11/18 and 18/11 are not considered (results are non-integer or not valid under our rules).

• Combining 11 and 20:  
  - 11 + 20 = 31, produces state: [31, 18]  
  - 11 − 20 = -9, produces state: [-9, 18]  
  - 20 − 11 = 9, produces state: [9, 18]  
  - 11 * 20 = 220, produces state: [220, 18]  
  - (Division operations are invalid as they do not produce integers.)

• Combining 18 and 20:  
  - 18 + 20 = 38, produces state: [38, 11]  
  - 18 − 20 = -2, produces state: [-2, 11]  
  - 20 − 18 = 2, produces state: [2, 11]  
  - 18 * 20 = 360, produces state: [360, 11]  
  - (Division operations again are not valid in producing clean integers.)

Now our frontier (states at depth 1) includes:  
[29, 20], [-7, 20], [7, 20], [198, 20], [31, 18], [-9, 18], [9, 18], [220, 18], [38, 11], [-2, 11], [2, 11], [360, 11].

─────────────────────────────  
Step 4: Explore Depth 2 Using BFS with Our Heuristic  
─────────────────────────────  
Now we take each state with two numbers and combine them. (Recall that when we have two numbers, a single operation will give us a final result. We then compute its difference from the target 27.)

Let’s expand the state that appears promising based on our heuristic:

Examine state from combining 18 and 20 that yielded [38, 11]:  
(Current operation details: 18+20 produced 38, and the remaining number is 11.)

Now, from state [38, 11] we can combine these two numbers:

1. Operation: 38 + 11 = 49  
   → Heuristic: |49 − 27| = 22. This is not perfect.

2. Operation: 38 − 11 = 27  
   → Heuristic: |27 − 27| = 0.  
   → Here the result exactly matches our target!  

3. (For completeness, we also check the other possibilities:)  
   Operation: 11 − 38 = -27 (Not 27)  
   Operation: 38 * 11 = 418 (Not 27)  
   Division operations: 38 / 11 is non-integer (and 11 / 38 is not useful).

Thus, among these operations, the promising candidate is clearly the one with the zero difference: 38 − 11 = 27.  

─────────────────────────────  
Step 5: Trace of the Successful Trajectory  
─────────────────────────────  
Let’s list the operations that led to the result:

Operation 1: Combine 18 and 20  
  18 + 20 = 38  
  (State becomes [38, 11])

Operation 2: Combine 38 and 11  
  38 − 11 = 27  
  (State becomes [27], which is our target.)

─────────────────────────────  
Step 6: Check the Constraints  
─────────────────────────────  
1. Use all initial numbers exactly once:  
   • Operation 1 used 18 and 20.  
   • Operation 2 used the result 38 and the remaining number 11.  
   → All three numbers [11, 18, 20] are used exactly once.

2. Only numbers from the initial list are involved (or results computed from them).  
   → Valid as 38 is computed from 18 and 20.

3. Arithmetic operations were applied correctly:  
   • 18+20 is indeed 38.  
   • 38−11 equals 27.

4. The final value matches the target 27.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 7: Backtracking Notes  
─────────────────────────────  
During the search, we expanded several nodes (like [29,20], [7,20], etc.) but none immediately gave a result as promising as state [38,11]. Even though we looked briefly at other nodes (e.g., state [9,18] or [31,18]), their combined results did not yield 27 on any valid operation. When those operations were computed, they resulted in values either too high or too low. Hence, we backtracked from these nodes and continued exploring the frontier. After testing several suboptimal trajectories, the path using [38,11] clearly stood out by yielding a heuristic value of 0. We then terminated further expansion. 

─────────────────────────────  
Final Answer  
─────────────────────────────  
Having confirmed that all constraints hold and the arithmetic is correct, we now report the final result in EXACTLY the required format:

SOLUTION: YES
OPERATIONS: ['18+20=38', '38-11=27']
RESULT: 27<|im_end|>

Below is a complete transcript of a simulated breadth-first search (BFS) using a heuristic to help guide us toward the target value 71 using the numbers [4, 20, 95]. Note that—even though the search problem is small—we will include several branches, including suboptimal ones, and explicitly detail any backtracking steps. Our goal is to use all the numbers exactly once and form an arithmetic expression (one operation per step) to reach exactly 71.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1: Define the Search Problem

• Initial state: {4, 20, 95}
• Goal: Use all numbers to obtain the target value 71.
• Allowed operations: +, -, *, /
• Each step chooses two numbers, applies one arithmetic operation, and replaces them with the result.
• Heuristic: We choose the absolute difference between the current computed intermediate value(s) and the target (71).  
  Rationale: The closer an intermediate result is to 71, the more promising that state is for expansion. (For states containing more than one number, we take into account the minimum absolute difference of any number available to the target. Note that when combining two numbers, we recalc and then assess heuristic for the resulting state.)

──────────────────────────────
Step 2: Initialize BFS

We start with the root node representing the state {4, 20, 95}. In our BFS queue, nodes are ordered first by depth and then by heuristic value. The heuristic here is:
  h(state) = min(|n - 71| for each n in state), when the state has single numbers after combining.

At the initial state, no intermediate computation exists as such so we begin expanding all pairs.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3: Level 1 – Expanding from {4, 20, 95}

At the initial level, we can form child nodes by picking any two numbers among the three and applying one of the four operations. List them along with computed results.

A. Choose pair (4, 20):

  1. Operation: 4 + 20 = 24  → New state: {24, 95}
    Heuristic: min(|24 - 71|, |95 - 71|) = min(47, 24) = 24.
  2. Operation: 4 - 20 = -16  → New state: {-16, 95}
    Heuristic: min(|-16 - 71|, |95 - 71|) = min(87, 24) = 24.
  3. Operation: 20 - 4 = 16  → New state: {16, 95}
    Heuristic: min(|16 - 71|, |95 - 71|) = min(55, 24) = 24.
  4. Operation: 4 * 20 = 80  → New state: {80, 95}
    Heuristic: min(|80 - 71|, |95 - 71|) = min(9, 24) = 9.
  5. Operation: 4 / 20 = 0.2  (not promising; we would then have {0.2, 95})
    Heuristic: min(|0.2 - 71|, |95 - 71|) = min(70.8, 24) = 24. (Fractional results tend to be less promising here.)
  6. Operation: 20 / 4 = 5  → New state: {5, 95}
    Heuristic: min(|5 - 71|, |95 - 71|) = min(66, 24) = 24.

B. Choose pair (4, 95):

  1. Operation: 4 + 95 = 99  → New state: {20, 99}
    Heuristic: min(|20 - 71|, |99 - 71|) = min(51, 28) = 28.
  2. Operation: 4 - 95 = -91  → New state: {20, -91}

    Heuristic: min(|20 - 71|, |380 - 71|) = min(51, 309) = 51.

    Heuristic: min(|20 - 71|, |23.75 - 71|) = min(51, 47.25) = 47.25.

C. Choose pair (20, 95):

  1. Operation: 20 + 95 = 115  → New state: {4, 115}
    Heuristic: min(|4 - 71|, |115 - 71|) = min(67, 44) = 44.
  2. Operation: 20 - 95 = -75  → New state: {4, -75}

  3. Operation: 95 - 20 = 75  → New state: {4, 75}
    Heuristic: min(|4 - 71|, |75 - 71|) = min(67, 4) = 4.  [Promising!]
  4. Operation: 20 * 95 = 1900  → New state: {4, 1900}
    Heuristic: min(|4 - 71|, |1900 - 71|) = min(67, 1829) = 67.
  5. Operation: 20 / 95 ≈ 0.2105  (not promising)
  6. Operation: 95 / 20 = 4.75  → New state: {4, 4.75}
    Heuristic: min(|4 - 71|, |4.75 - 71|) = min(67, 66.25) = 66.25.

Observations:
 – Among all children, state {4, 75} obtained from (95 - 20 = 75) has the best (lowest) heuristic (4 away from 71 using the 75) and is the one we would like to pursue first.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4: Level 2 – Expanding the promising node {4, 75}

Our promising node is from picking (20, 95) with the operation 95 - 20 = 75 giving state {4, 75}.

Now we have two numbers; the only legal move is combining them with one operation:

For numbers 4 and 75:

 1. Operation: 4 + 75 = 79   → Heuristic: |79 - 71| = 8.
 2. Operation: 4 - 75 = -71   → Heuristic: |-71 - 71| = 142.
 3. Operation: 75 - 4 = 71   → Heuristic: |71 - 71| = 0.  [Exact match!]
 4. Operation: 4 * 75 = 300   → Heuristic: |300 - 71| = 229.
 5. Operation: 4 / 75 ≈ 0.0533  (not useful)
 6. Operation: 75 / 4 = 18.75   → Heuristic: |18.75 - 71| = 52.25.

The operation 75 - 4 gives exactly 71. This is our candidate solution!

──────────────────────────────
Step 5: Validate the Candidate Solution

Our candidate solution is:
 - First operation: 95 - 20 = 75  (from state {4, 20, 95})
 - Second operation: 75 - 4 = 71  (from state {4, 75})

Now we double-check:
 1. Are all initial numbers used exactly once?  
  - Yes, the numbers 95 and 20 were combined in the first move and 4 was used only in the second move.
 2. Did we use any extraneous numbers?  
  - No, only the given numbers 4, 20, and 95 were used.
 3. Are the arithmetic operations applied correctly?  
  - For 95 - 20, we get 75.  
  - For 75 - 4, we get 71.  
  - Both arithmetic operations are correct.

──────────────────────────────
Step 6: Reflect on Alternate (Suboptimal) Branches

For completeness, here are some alternate trajectories we explored (and then backtracked from):

• From pair (4, 20), the state {80, 95} (via 4 * 20) had a heuristic value of 9 but even combining them later, none produced exactly 71 (e.g., 95 - 80 = 15, 80 - 95 = -15, 95 + 80 = 175, etc.).  
• Similarly, from pair (4, 95), we produced states like {20, 91} or {20, 99}, which had heuristics of 20 or 28 respectively; further operations did not yield 71 upon checking.  
• Also, other operations like performing division early yielded fractional values that increased the distance from the target when further combined.

Thus, the best (and eventually correct) branch was the one using (95,20) with 95 - 20 to get 75, and then combining 75 with 4 by calculating 75 - 4.

──────────────────────────────
Step 7: Final Result

After completing our search and confirming that the chosen operations use each number exactly once, only use the provided numbers, and yield the correct arithmetic result, we conclude our solution.

Final answer in EXACTLY the required format:

--------------------------------------------------

Hi! You'll be playing the countdown game using search strategies. In the Countdown game, we start with a set of four initial numbers (e.g., [1,2,4,5]) and a target value (e.g., 14). Our goal is to use arithmetic operations (+,-,*,/) to produce the target using all of the numbers. 

We formalize this game as a search problem:
- States: Sets of remaining numbers
- Initial State: Set of initial numbers
- Goal State: Using all numbers to reach target value
- Actions: Choose two numbers, apply an operation (+, -, *, /), replace them with the result
Constraints:
- All 4 numbers must be used exactly once

I'd like you to generate detailed reasoning traces for this game that: 
1. Uses depth first search with a heuristic. Propose a heuristic you think is promising and explain why 
2. Go through the full search trajectory in a structured manner towards the target using that strategy, with articulated thought processes 
3. Includes suboptimal trajectories (encouraged) and make explicit where you need to backtrack to a previously visited node. Brevity is not important here, rather it would be great if you can write out your entire search trajectory in a structured manner.
4. Conclude with the final result in EXACTLY this format:
```
SOLUTION: YES/NO
OPERATIONS: [list of operations performed]
RESULT: final_value
```

For example, a successful solution might end with:
```
SOLUTION: YES
OPERATIONS: ['75-72=3', '3*2=6', '66/6=11']
RESULT: 11
```
Note that each string in the list of OPERATIONS involves only 1 operation each. For example, 'A+B=C' is allowed, 'A+B/C=D' is not allowed because that involves 2 operations in the string.

An unsuccessful attempt might end with:
```
SOLUTION: NO
OPERATIONS: []
RESULT: None
```

Could you provide a detailed reasoning trace for making 26 using the numbers [77, 13, 90]? 
When you have reached a solution during the search that arrives at the target, please double check if the operations
1. use all the initial numbers once, 
2. used any numbers not in the list at all,
3. applied the arithmetics correctly. 
Otherwise, reflect on all mistakes and repeat the search process. 
Once you've reached the target and the result passes your check, report the final answer in the format given. The evaluation code will specifically look for these exact keywords and format in the final lines to extract the solution details.

Below is my detailed reasoning trace using a depth-first search approach augmented by a simple heuristic. I chose the following heuristic: for each operation resulting in an intermediate value, estimate its “promise” by taking the absolute difference |result – target|. Operations yielding intermediate numbers with a lower difference to the target (26) are prioritized. This heuristic is promising because it directly favors moves that bring the current computation closer to the target, which is especially helpful in puzzles where the arithmetic “distance” can guide the search.

────────────────────────────
Step 1. Initial state:
 Numbers: {77, 13, 90}
 Target: 26

Heuristic estimate: For each pair and operation, I’ll compute the result and then |result – 26|. I try DFS on various pair selections.

────────────────────────────
Step 2. First DFS branch: Consider the pair (77, 13)

1. Operation: 77 + 13
  Result = 90
  Heuristic: |90 – 26| = 64
  New state: {90, 90}  (note: the original 90 remains and the new 90 from the operation; also note that repeating numbers is allowed as a result of operations but we must have used each original number exactly once)
  Observation: Although 90 is far from 26, let’s explore.
  Next, combining the two 90’s:
   - 90 – 90 = 0  |0 – 26| = 26
   - 90 / 90 = 1  |1 – 26| = 25
   - 90 + 90 = 180  |180 – 26| = 154
   - 90 * 90 = 8100  |8100 – 26| = 8074
  None of these results equal 26.
  Conclusion: This branch does not yield a solution.
  Backtracking to try a different operation on (77, 13).

2. Operation: 77 – 13
  Result = 64
  Heuristic: |64 – 26| = 38
  New state: {64, 90}
  Now try combining 64 and 90:
   - 90 – 64 = 26  |26 – 26| = 0, which is exactly the target.
   Let’s check this: If we choose operation “90 - 64 = 26”, then the operations would be:
    Operation 1: 77 – 13 = 64  [used 77 and 13]
    Operation 2: 90 - 64 = 26  [used 90 (original) and 64 (result)]
   However, note the constraint: every operation string must involve a single operation and we must use each original number exactly once. In this branch, the 64 is generated from (77,13) and then we combine it with 90. That is acceptable.  
  Double-check arithmetic:
   77 – 13 = 64  ✔
   90 – 64 = 26  ✔  
  This branch appears to yield a valid solution.  
  Before committing, let’s check the rule “using all numbers exactly once.” Here the original numbers are 77, 13, and 90. In operation one, 77 and 13 are consumed; in operation two, we combine the result (64) with 90. Hence, all initial numbers have been used exactly once.
  We have reached the target 26.  
  I now record this branch as a potential solution.
  Note: Although the heuristic value here was not as good as some candidates (compared to the branch below), this branch works and satisfies all constraints.

3. I could also consider other operations from (77, 13), such as 13 – 77 or multiplication or division, but since we already obtained one valid result on this branch, I will mark it as successful. (For completeness, I note that branching to other operations would have been attempted if this branch failed.)

────────────────────────────
Step 3. Alternative DFS branch: Consider the pair (90, 77)

Another promising approach using our heuristic is to choose the pair (90, 77) directly:
 Operation: 90 – 77
  Result = 13
  Heuristic: |13 – 26| = 13  (which is relatively close to 26)
  New state: {13, 13}  (the first 13 arises from 90 – 77, and the other is the original 13)
 tNext, combine these two:
  Operation: 13 + 13
   Result = 26  |26 – 26| = 0, exactly the target.
 Double-check arithmetic:
  90 – 77 = 13  ✔
  13 + 13 = 26  ✔  
 Using original numbers: 90, 77, and 13 are all used exactly once (the “13” from the first operation and the original 13).
 This branch, like the one above, provides a valid solution.

Since both branches are valid, I note that the branch starting with (90,77) is even more promising with a lower heuristic cost (13 instead of 38 at the intermediate step).

────────────────────────────
Step 4. Verifying the successful branch with (90, 77):

Let’s recheck the branch:
 Operation 1: “90-77=13”
  – Uses original 90 and 77.
 Operation 2: “13+13=26”
  – Uses result from operation 1 (a 13) and the remaining original 13.
 All initial numbers [77, 13, 90] are used exactly once.
 Arithmetic checks out.

────────────────────────────
Conclusion:

After exploring multiple branches and backtracking where necessary, the branch:
 (90,77) → (90-77=13) then (result, original 13) → (13+13=26)
yields the target value 26 fulfilling all constraints.

────────────────────────────
Final Result (in EXACT format):

```
SOLUTION: YES
OPERATIONS: ['90-77=13', '13+13=26']
RESULT: 26
