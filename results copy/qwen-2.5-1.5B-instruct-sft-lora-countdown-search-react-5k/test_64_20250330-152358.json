I need to combine these initial numbers [6, 39, 42, 24] using only arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach the target value 36. All initial numbers must be used exactly once.\n \nLet's explain the thought process step by step:\n \n1. **Initial Numbers**: [6, 39, 42, 24].\n2. **Target Value**: 36.\n3. **Objective**: Combine these numbers using only arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach the target value 36.\n\nWe have these initial numbers [6, 39, 42, 24]. Our goal is to produce 36. Let\u2019s explore all possible combinations of these numbers using arithmetic operations:\n\nOne possible strategy is to use Depth-First Search (DFS) guided by a **sum-based** heuristic, which computes the average of the absolute differences between each number and the target number.\nLower scores indicate that, on average, the numbers are closer to the target, making the state more promising for reaching the target via additive operations.\n\n\nCurrent State #0: 36:[6, 39, 42, 24].

You are a helpful assistant.\nuser\nCombine these initial numbers [40, 81, 36, 69] using only arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach the target value 64. All initial numbers must be used exactly once.\nConclude with the final result in EXACTLY this format:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\nOPERATIONS: list of string of operations performed, each string involving only 1 operation. For example, ['A+B=C','C+D=E'] is allowed, ['A+B+D=E'] is not allowed\nRESULT: final_value\n```\n\nassistant\nWe have these numbers [40, 81, 36, 69]. Our goal is to produce 64. Let's show the search process step by step:\nOne possible strategy is to use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) with Beam Size 5 guided by a **sum-based** heuristic, which computes the average of the absolute differences between each number and the target number.\nLower scores indicate that, on average, the numbers are closer to the target, making the state more promising for reaching the target via additive operations.\n\n\nCurrent State #0: 64:[40, 81, 36, 69].

You want me to combine these initial numbers [4, 29, 28, 60] using only arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach the target value 16. All initial numbers must be used exactly once. Let's solve it step by step:\n1. The target value is 16.\n2. We have these numbers [4, 29, 28, 60].\n3. Let's show the initial state:\n   Initial Numbers: [4, 29, 28, 60]\n4. Converting the initial numbers to a list of strings for manipulation:\n   ['4', '29', '28', '60']\n5. Our goal is to produce 16.

One possible strategy is to use Depth-First Search (DFS) guided by a **sum-based** heuristic, which computes the average of the absolute differences between each number and the target number.\n7. Lower scores indicate that, on average, the numbers are closer to the target, making the state more promising for reaching the target via additive operations.\n\n\nCurrent State: Operations [['4', '29', '28', '60'], ['60-4=56', '56-29=27', '27-28=-1', '-1*29=-29']].

Let's show the search process step by step:\nOne possible strategy is to use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) with Beam Size 5 guided by a **sum-based** heuristic, which computes the average of the absolute differences between each number and the target number.\nLower scores indicate that, on average, the numbers are closer to the target, making the state more promising for reaching the target via additive operations.\n\n\nCurrent State #0: 12:[17, 69, 90, 3].

Let's show the search process step by step:\nOne possible strategy is to use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) with Beam Size 5 guided by a **sum-based** heuristic, which computes the average of the absolute differences between each number and the target number.\nLower scores indicate that, on average, the numbers are closer to the target, making the state more promising for reaching the target via additive operations.\n\n\nCurrent State #0: 37:[7, 70, 42, 21].

I need to combine these initial numbers [6, 43, 2, 19] using only arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach the target value 60. All initial numbers must be used exactly once.\nThought process:\n1. We have initial numbers [6, 43, 2, 19].\n2. Our goal is to produce 60.\n3. One possible strategy is to use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) guided by a **sum-based** heuristic, which computes the average of the absolute differences between each number and the target number.\nLower scores indicate that, on average, the numbers are closer to the target, making the state more promising for reaching the target via additive operations.\n\n\nCurrent State #0: 60:[6, 43, 2, 19].
