    "<think> Okay, let's see. I need to combine the numbers 9, 62, 67, and 5 using each exactly once with any arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get to 20. Hmm. All numbers must be used, so I need to figure out the right combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, maybe I should list out all possible permutations of the numbers and try different operations between them. But that's a lot. Let's think step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me start by considering the target 20. Since some of the numbers are much larger (like 62 and 67), maybe I need to subtract or divide them to bring the value down. For example, 67 minus something might get a smaller number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, let's see. Let's think of possible pairs. If I take 67 and 62. 67-62=5. But we already have a 5, so maybe that's redundant. Alternatively, 67 divided by something. Or maybe multiply some numbers and then subtract others.\n",

    "\n",
    "Wait, another idea. Let's try 67 - (something) = 20. So 67 - x =20 → x=47. How to get 47 from the remaining numbers 9,62,5. So 9,62,5. Let's see: 62 - (9+5) = 62-14=48. Close but not 47. Or 62 -9=53, 53-5=48. Still no. Alternatively, 9*5=45. 62-45=17. Not 47. Hmm. Not helpful.\n",

    "Alternatively, maybe divide. For example, 62 / (something) could give a value. Let's see, 62 divided by 5 is 12.4. 9 + 12.4 = 21.4. Then 67 - that? 67-21.4=45.6. Not helpful.\n",

    "Step1: 67 -62 = A (A=5)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, remaining numbers are 9,5, and A (5). Wait, but the original 5 is still there. So then step2: 9 -5= B (B=4). Then step3: A * B=5*4=20.\n",

    "Wait, this is ambiguous. Because after step1, we have intermediate value 5 (from 67-62) and the original 5. But when we write the steps, each step uses two of the remaining numbers. So in step2, perhaps we have to use the original 5 and the 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, maybe not. Because after step1, the numbers available are 9,5 (original), and the intermediate 5. But the problem requires that each initial number is used exactly once. So in step1, 67 and 62 are used. Then in step2, we have to use two of the remaining numbers:9 and 5. Because the intermediate 5 is a result of step1, not the original number. So the original 5 must be used in another step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, this is a confusion. Let me think again. The original numbers are 9,62,67,5. Each must be used once. So in step1, if I use 67-62=5, that uses 67 and 62. The remaining numbers are 9 and 5. So step2 must use those two. Then step3 uses the two intermediate results.\n",

    "step2: 9+5=14 (using 9 and 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "But then step3: 5 and 14. How to combine them. 5*14=70, 5-14=-9, etc. Not 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, step2: 9-5=4. Then step3: 5 (from step1) *4=20.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes! So in step2, we use the original 5 and the 9. So all initial numbers are used. The intermediate results are 5 (from step1) and 4 (from step2). Then multiply them to get 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the operations would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "['67-62=5', '9-5=4', '5*4=20']\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait, in step3, the two 5s: the first 5 is from step1 (67-62), and the 4 is from step2 (9-5). So those are the two intermediates.\n",

    "\n",
    "First, I need to recall that I can only use each number once, so every operation must involve two of the initial numbers, and then I can combine the result with the next, and so on. I guess the key here is to find a sequence of operations that gets me as close as possible to 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me list out the numbers again: 9, 62, 67, 5. The target is 20, which is relatively small compared to some of these numbers. So I might need to use division or subtraction to bring down some of the larger numbers.\n",

    "\n",
    "Alternatively, maybe I can create two intermediate results and then combine them. Let me try combining 62 and 67 first. If I add them, that's 129, which is way too big.

    "\n",
    "Wait, the first operation is 67 - 62 = 5. Then I have 9, 5, and 5 (but only one 5 is allowed). So that's not possible. So perhaps that's not the way.\n",

    "9 - 5 = 4\n",

Let me think step by step.\\n\\nFirst, maybe I can try some operations with the larger numbers. 60 is the biggest. Let\\'s see. If I subtract something from 60 to get closer to 75. Wait, but 60 is already less than 75. So maybe adding? But 60 plus 27 would be 87, which is over. Then maybe multiply. Wait, but 60 * something would be way too big. Like 60*27 is 1620, way over. So maybe division?\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe combine the smaller numbers first. Let\\'s see: 25 and 21. If I add them, 25+21=46. Then 27 and 60 left. Hmm, 27 plus 60 is 87. Then 87 - 46 = 41. Not helpful.\\n\\nWait, maybe 27 - 25 = 2. Then 60 + 2 = 62, and 62 +21=83. No. Not enough.\\n\\nAlternatively, 25 minus 21 is 4. Then 60 + 27=87. 87 -4=83. Still not 75.\\n\\nHmm. Let\\'s think of possible combinations. Maybe combining 60 and 27 first. Let\\'s see:\\n\\n60 +27 = 87. Then 87 - something. Let\\'s see, what\\'s left is 25 and 21. So 25+21=46. 87-46=41. Not 75. Alternatively, 25 *21=525. Then 87 -525 would be way negative. No.\\n\\nWait, maybe 60 divided by something. 60 divided by (27-25) would be 60/(2)=30. Then 30 plus 21=51. Not enough.\\n\\nAnother approach: 27 + 25 = 52. 21 + 60=81. Then 81 -52=29. No.\\n\\nWait, maybe subtract 21 from 25 to get 4. Then multiply by 27? 27 *4=108. Then 108 -60=48. Not helpful.\\n\\nAlternatively, 27 +25 +21 =73. Then 73 + (60-60) ? No, can\\'t reuse numbers.\\n\\nWait, maybe multiply 27 and 21. 27*21=567. That\\'s way too big. Then 567 plus others? Not helpful.\\n\\nHmm, perhaps using division. Let\\'s see, 60 divided by (25 -21). 25-21=4. 60/4=15. Then 15 plus 27=42. No.\\n\\nWait another idea: 60 - (27 -25) =60-2=58. Then 58 +21=79. Close but not 75.\\n\\nWhat if I do 25 - (21) =4. Then 27 *4=108. 108 -60=48. No.\\n\\nAlternatively, 60 -25=35. Then 35 +27=62. 62 +21=83. No. Not enough.\\n\\nWait, maybe 60 divided by 25. That\\'s 2.4. 2.4 *27=64.8. 64.8 +21=85.8. Not an integer, but maybe the problem allows decimals. But the target is 75. Not sure.\\n\\nAlternatively, 25 *3=75. But where do I get the 3? Let\\'s see. 27 divided by (something). 27 divided by 9 is 3. But how to get 9. 21 - (60/ something). Hmm, maybe 60 - 21=39. Then 27 - (39 / something). Not sure.\\n\\nWait, perhaps 27 + 21=48. Then 60 - (48 -25). Let\\'s see: 48-25=23. 60-23=37. Not helpful.\\n\\nAnother approach: 60 - 27=33. 25 +21=46. 33 +46=79. Again, not 75.\\n\\nWait, maybe multiply 25 and 3. How to get 3. 27 divided by 9? 9 can be 21 - 12, but not sure.\\n\\nHmm. Let\\'s think differently. Let\\'s try all possible operations in steps.\\n\\nWe have four numbers: a=60, b=27, c=25, d=21. Must use all in some order.\\n\\nPossible approach:\\n\\nStep 1: Combine two numbers.\\n\\nThen step 2: combine the result with another.\\n\\nThen step 3: combine the result with the last.\\n\\nEach operation uses two numbers and replaces them with the result.\\n\\nSo possible combinations.\\n\\nFirst, possible pairs:\\n\\nOption 1: Start with 60 and 27.\\n\\n60 +27=87. Then we have 87,25,21. Now combine two of these.\\n\\nMaybe 25 +21=46. Then 87-46=41. No.\\n\\nAlternatively, 87 -25=62. Then 62 +21=83. No.\\n\\nOr 87 *25=2175. Not useful.\\n\\nOption 2: 60 -27=33. Then 33,25,21. Now, maybe 25+21=46. 33+46=79. No.\\n\\nOption 3: 60 *27=1620. Too big.\\n\\nOption 4: 60 /27 ≈2.222. Then 2.222 +25=27.222. Then +21=48.222. No.\\n\\nNot helpful. So perhaps starting with other numbers.\\n\\nOption 5: Combine 25 and 21. 25 +21=46. Then we have 60,27,46. Then maybe 60 +27=87. 87-46=41. No.\\n\\nOr 60 -27=33. 33 +46=79. No.\\n\\nHmm. What if 25 *21=525. Then 60 +27=87. 525-87=438. Not helpful.\\n\\nAlternative approach: Maybe combine 27 and 25. 27 +25=52. Then 60 -21=39. Then 52 +39=91. No.\\n\\nOr 52 * (60-21). 60-21=39. 52*39=2028. Way too big.\\n\\nAnother idea: 27 -25=2. Then 60 +2=62. Then 62 +21=83. No.\\n\\nWait, maybe 60 / (25 - (27-21)) ?\\n\\nWait, 27-21=6. Then 25-6=19. 60 /19 ≈3.157. Then 3.157 *27 ≈85.28. Not helpful.\\n\\nAlternatively, 27 +21=48. Then 60 -48=12. Then 12 *25=300. No.\\n\\nHmm. Maybe (60 - (27 +25)) *21. But that\\'s (60-52)=8. 8*21=168. No.\\n\\nAlternatively, 60 -27=33. 33 * (25 -21). 25-21=4. 33*4=132. No.\\n\\nWait, maybe 27 * (25 -21) =27 *4=108. Then 108 -60=48. No.\\n\\nAlternatively, 60 - (27 -25) =60-2=58. Then 58 +21=79. Not 75.\\n\\nWait, how about 60 - (25 - (27 -21))? Let\\'s calculate 27-21=6. 25-6=19. 60-19=41. No.\\n\\nHmm. Another approach: maybe 60 + 25 =85. Then 85 - (27 -21)=85-6=79. No. Still not.\\n\\nWait, what if I do (60 -25) + (27 +21). 60-25=35. 27+21=48. 35+48=83. No.\\n\\nWait, perhaps (60 + (27 -25)) * (21 / something). Not sure.\\n\\nAlternatively, 60 divided by 25 is 2.4. 2.4 multiplied by 21 is 50.4. Then 50.4 +27=77.4. Close to 75, but not exact.\\n\\nAlternatively, 27 +21=48. 60 -48=12. Then 25 -12=13. But how? Maybe combining as 25 - (60 - (27 +21)) =25 -12=13. No, that\\'s not 75.\\n\\nWait, perhaps 25 *3 =75. How to get 3 from the remaining numbers. 60,27,21. Hmm. 27 - (60 / 21). Wait, 60 divided by 21 is approximately 2.857. 27 - that is around 24.14. Not 3.\\n\\nAlternatively, (27 -21) =6. 60 /6=10. Then 25 *10=250. No. Not 75.\\n\\nHmm. Maybe using subtraction and multiplication. Let\\'s see. 60 - (27 * (25 -21)). So 25-21=4. 27*4=108. 60-108= -48. No.\\n\\nAlternatively, (60 -27) * (25 -21). 33 *4=132. No.\\n\\nAlternatively, 27 * (25 +21) =27*46=1242. Then 1242 divided by 60 is 20.7. No.\\n\\nWait, another angle. Let\\'s see the target is 75. So possible combinations that get to 75. For example, 60 +15=75. So how to get 15 from 27,25,21. But how?\\n\\n15 could be 27 -12. 12 from 25 and 21. Wait, 25-21=4. 27-4=23. Not 15. Alternatively, 25 - (21 - something). Not sure.\\n\\nAlternatively, 21 - (25 - something). Hmm. Maybe 27 - (25 -21) =27-4=23. Then 60+23=83. No.\\n\\nWait, maybe 27 +25 +21=73. Then 73 + (60/60)=74. No, can\\'t reuse 60.\\n\\nAlternatively, 27 +25=52. 60 -21=39. 52 +39=91. No.\\n\\nHmm. Maybe division with some combination. Let\\'s try 60/(27-25) =60/2=30. Then 30 +21=51. No. Not enough.\\n\\nWait, 27 + 25 +21 =73. Then 60 - (some number) gives 73 +2=75. But how to get that 2. Maybe 60 divided by (27 - (25 -21))? Let\\'s calculate 25-21=4. 27-4=23. 60/23 is about 2.6. Not helpful.\\n\\nWait, 27 +21=48. 60 -48=12. Then 25 -12=13. Not helpful.\\n\\nAnother idea: 25 *3=75. How to get 3. Let\\'s see: 27 divided by (21 - (something)). For example, 21 - (60/ something). Let\\'s think. 60 divided by (25 - (27 -21)) ?\\n\\nWait 27-21=6. 25-6=19. 60 /19 ≈3.157. Then 25 *3.157≈78.9. Close to 75 but not exact.\\n\\nAlternatively, 60 divided by (27 -21) =60/6=10. Then 25 *10=250. No.\\n\\nHmm. Maybe multiply 25 and 3 to get 75, where 3 is 27 - 24. But 24 comes from 60 divided by 2.5. Not an integer.\\n\\nWait, let me try another approach. Let\\'s list all possible operations between pairs and see:\\n\\nFirst pair combinations:\\n\\n60 and 27:\\n\\n+ →87; -→33; *→1620; /→60/27≈2.222.\\n\\n60 and 25:\\n\\n+→85; -→35; *→1500; /→60/25=2.4.\\n\\n60 and 21:\\n\\n+→81; -→39; *→1260; /→60/21≈2.857.\\n\\n27 and 25:\\n\\n+→52; -→2; *→675; /→27/25=1.08.\\n\\n27 and 21:\\n\\n+→48; -→6; *→567; /→27/21≈1.2857.\\n\\n25 and 21:\\n\\n+→46; -→4; *→525; /→25/21≈1.1905.\\n\\nThen, after the first operation, we have three numbers left. Let\\'s see possible paths.\\n\\nLet me pick one pair and see possibilities. For example, take 27 and 25. Let\\'s try 27 -25 =2. Then the remaining numbers are 60,21,2.\\n\\nNext step: combine two of these. Let\\'s say 60 +21=81. Then combine 81 and 2: 81 -2=79. No. Or 60 *2=120, 120 +21=141. No.\\n\\nAlternatively, after 27-25=2, combine 60 and 2. 60+2=62. Then 62 +21=83. No.\\n\\nAnother approach: 27+25=52. Then 52,60,21. Combine 60-21=39. Then 52+39=91. No.\\n\\nHmm. What if first do 25 -21=4. Then numbers are 60,27,4. Then 60 -27=33. 33 +4=37. No. Or 60 +27=87. 87 -4=83.\\n\\nAlternatively, 27*4=108. 108-60=48. No.\\n\\nAnother path: 60 / (25-21) →60/4=15. Then numbers are 15,27,21. Then 27+21=48. 15+48=63. No. Or 27*15=405, then 405+21=426. Not helpful.\\n\\nAlternatively, 27-21=6. Then 60,25,6. 25*6=150. 150-60=90. No. 60+25=85. 85-6=79. No.\\n\\nHmm. What if 60 -25=35. Then 35,27,21. Combine 35 and 27: 35+27=62. 62+21=83. No. Or 35*27=945. Not helpful.\\n\\nAlternatively, 35-21=14. 14+27=41. No.\\n\\nWait, maybe multiply 27 and 21. 27*21=567. Then 567 divided by (60-25). 60-25=35. 567/35=16.2. Then 16.2 + something? Not 75.\\n\\nAnother idea: 60 - (27 +25) =60-52=8. Then 8 *21=168. No.\\n\\nAlternatively, 60 - (27 +25 +21) =60-73= -13. No.\\n\\nWait, maybe 60 + (27 -25) =60+2=62. Then 62 *21=1302. No. Then divide by something. Not helpful.\\n\\nHmm. Let\\'s try combining 60 and 21 first. 60 -21=39. Then 39,27,25. 39+27=66. 66+25=91. No. Or 27+25=52. 39+52=91. No.\\n\\nAlternatively, 39*25=975. Then 975/27≈36.1. No.\\n\\nWait, maybe 60 *21=1260. Then 1260 divided by (27+25)=1260/52≈24.23. Not helpful.\\n\\nHmm. Maybe 25 * (something) =75. Let\\'s see, 25*3=75. So need to get 3 from 60,27,21.\\n\\nHow to get 3 from 60,27,21. Let\\'s see: 27/(60-21). 60-21=39. 27/39=0.692. No. Or (60-27)/21=33/21≈1.571. No.\\n\\nAlternatively, 21/(60-27) =21/33≈0.636. No. Not 3.\\n\\nHmm. Another approach. Let\\'s see: 75 can be written as 60 + 15. Can I get 15 from 27,25,21?\\n\\nHow? 25 - (27-21) =25-6=19. No. 27 - (25-21)=27-4=23. No. 27 - (21) =6. 25 -6=19. No.\\n\\nWait, 21 + (25 -27) =21-2=19. No.\\n\\nHmm. Maybe 27 +21=48. 25 - (something)=15. 25-10=15. How to get 10 from 60 and 48? 60-48=12. Not 10. Or 60/ (48/ something). Not sure.\\n\\nAlternatively, 27 - (60/ (25-21)) →27 - (60/4)=27-15=12. Then 25-21=4. So 12 and 4. Then 60-12=48. Wait, this is getting too complicated.\\n\\nWait, maybe 60 divided by (something) to get 5. 60/5=12. Then 27 -12=15. 25+21=46. 15+46=61. No.\\n\\nAlternatively, 27 * (25 - (21 - (60/ something)))... This seems too nested.\\n\\nHmm. Maybe I should try a different method. Let\\'s consider all possible permutations and operations. But that\\'s a lot.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is YES. Let\\'s see. Maybe there\\'s a combination I\\'m missing.\\n\\nWait, another approach: 60 - 25 =35. Then 35 * (27 -21). 27-21=6. 35*6=210. Then 210 divided by something. Wait, but we have to use all numbers. So far, 60-25=35, then 27-21=6. Then 35*6=210. But how do we combine all four numbers?\\n\\nWait, the problem says all initial numbers must be used exactly once. So each operation should combine two numbers, and the next operation uses the result and another number, etc. So perhaps:\\n\\nFirst, 27 -21=6. Now we have 60,25,6.\\n\\nNext, 25 *6=150. Now we have 60 and 150.\\n\\nThen, 150 -60=90. No. Not 75.\\n\\nAlternatively, first 60 +25=85. Then 85 -27=58. Then 58 +21=79. No.\\n\\nAnother path: 27 +25=52. Then 52 +21=73. 73 +60=133. No.\\n\\nAlternatively, 60 / (25 - (27 -21)). Let\\'s compute 27-21=6. 25-6=19. 60/19≈3.157. Then 3.157 *27≈85.28. Not 75.\\n\\nHmm. Let\\'s try another order. Let\\'s say, first 25 +21=46. Then 60 -46=14. Then 14 +27=41. No.\\n\\nAlternatively, 25 *21=525. Then 525 / (60 -27) =525/33≈15.909. Then 15.909 + something? Not helpful.\\n\\nWait, 27 * (60 - (25 +21)) →60-46=14. 27*14=378. Not 75.\\n\\nAlternatively, 60 -27=33. 25 +21=46. 33 +46=79. No.\\n\\nAnother Idea: Maybe 60 - (27 +25 +21) =60-73= -13. No.\\n\\nWait, maybe (60 +21) - (27 -25) →81 -2=79. No.\\n\\nHmm. Maybe 27 * (60 / (25 -21)) →25-21=4. 60/4=15. 27*15=405. No. Not 75.\\n\\nWait, what if we divide 60 by (27 - (25 -21))?\\n\\nCompute 25-21=4. 27-4=23. 60/23 ≈2.608. Then multiply by 25? 2.608*25≈65.2. Then add 21? 65.2+21=86.2. Not helpful.\\n\\nHmm. I\\'m stuck. Maybe I need to think of using subtraction and division in a clever way. Let me try:\\n\\n60 - (25 - (27 /21)) →27/21≈1.2857. 25 -1.2857≈23.714. 60-23.714≈36.285. No.\\n\\nAlternatively, (27 +21) * (60 /25). 48 * (2.4)=115.2. No.\\n\\nWait, 60 /25=2.4. 2.4 *21=50.4. 50.4 +27=77.4. Close to 75, but not exact.\\n\\nAnother Idea: 25 * (27 -21) →25*6=150. 150 -60=90. Then 90- something. But we already used all numbers? Wait, 25 is used, 27-21=6 (so used 27 and 21), then 150-60=90. All numbers are used. So 90 is the result. But target is 75.\\n\\nHmm. Not helpful.\\n\\nWait, maybe 60 - (27 +25) =60-52=8. Then 8 *21=168. No.\\n\\nWait, 60 -27=33. 33 * (25 -21) =33 *4=132. 132 - something? No, we used all numbers. So 132.\\n\\nNo. Not 75.\\n\\nHmm. Maybe I\\'m missing something obvious. Let\\'s try all possible combinations again.\\n\\nWait, 27 +25 +21 =73. Then 73 + (60-60)=73. No, can\\'t reuse.\\n\\nAlternatively, 60 - (25 - (27 +21)) →27+21=48. 25-48= -23. 60 - (-23)=83. No.\\n\\nWait, 25 +21=46. 27 * something. 27 * (60 -46)=27*14=378. No.\\n\\nHmm. Maybe 60 + (27 - (25 +21)). 25+21=46. 27-46=-19. 60-19=41. No.\\n\\nAnother Idea: 27 * (25 - (60 /21)). Let\\'s calculate 60/21≈2.857. 25-2.857≈22.143. 27*22.143≈598. So that\\'s way over.\\n\\nHmm. I\\'m really struggling here. Let me check if it\\'s possible. The target is 75, which is 25 *3. So maybe using 25 multiplied by 3 from other numbers. But how?\\n\\nLet\\'s see, 3 can be 27 divided by 9. How to get 9? 9 is 21 - (60/ something). 60 divided by (25- something). Hmm, not sure.\\n\\nAlternatively, 3 is 60 divided by 20. 20 can be 25 -5. 5 can be 21 -16. Not helpful.\\n\\nAlternatively, 27 - 24=3. 24 is 60 divided by 2.5. Not an integer.\\n\\nHmm. Another Idea: 60 - ( (27 -25) *21 ). 27-25=2. 2*21=42. 60-42=18. No.\\n\\nAlternatively, (27 -25) * (60 -21) =2*39=78. Close to 75. 78-3=75. But where to get the 3? Not possible.\\n\\nWait, 78 is 3 more than 75. But we have used all numbers. So maybe not.\\n\\nAlternatively, 27 * (25 - (21 - (60 / something))). Hmm. This is getting too complicated.\\n\\nWait, let\\'s try another approach: write down the equation. Let\\'s say ((a op b) op c) op d =75. But with a=60, b=27, c=25, d=21.\\n\\nLet\\'s see:\\n\\nFirst operation: op1 between a and b. Then op2 between result and c. Then op3 between that result and d.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\na + b =87. Then 87 op2 c. Let\\'s try 87 -25=62. Then 62 +21=83. No.\\n\\na -b=33. Then 33 +25=58. 58 +21=79. No.\\n\\na *b=1620. Then 1620 /25=64.8. 64.8 +21=85.8. No.\\n\\na /b≈2.222. Then 2.222 +25=27.222. +21=48.222. No.\\n\\nNot helpful.\\n\\nAnother possible order: ((b op c) op a) op d.\\n\\nLike:\\n\\nb +c=52. 52 +a=112. 112 -d=91. No.\\n\\nb *c=675. 675 -a=615. 615 /d=615/21≈29.28. No.\\n\\nAnother order: (c op d) op a op b.\\n\\nc +d=46. 46 +a=106. 106 -b=79. No.\\n\\nc *d=525. 525 -a=465. 465 /b=465/27≈17.22. No.\\n\\nHmm. This isn\\'t working. Maybe try operations with division that can get to 75.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n60 / (27 - (25 -21)) ?\\n\\n27 - (25-21)=27-4=23. 60/23≈2.608. Then multiply by 25: 2.608 *25=65.2. Then add 21: 86.2. No.\\n\\nAlternatively, (60 +25) * (21 /27). 85 * (0.777)=66. Not 75.\\n\\nAlternatively, 60 - (27 / (25/21)). Let\\'s compute 25/21≈1.1905. 27 /1.1905≈22.68. 60-22.68≈37.32. No.\\n\\nHmm. Maybe there\\'s a way to do (60 * something) - something else.\\n\\nWait, 60 *1.25=75. 1.25 is 5/4. Can I get 5/4 from 27 and 21 and 25?\\n\\nHmm. Let\\'s see, (25 -21) =4. 27 - (something) to get 5. But 27-22=5. Where does 22 come from? 60 divided by something. 60 divided by (22) is 2.727. Not helpful.\\n\\nAlternatively, (27 +21)/ something. 48 / something. 48/  (25 - (60/something)). Not sure.\\n\\nThis is really tough. Maybe the answer is no. But the note says \"Note that the solution must exist\". Oh, wait! The user note says \"the solution must exist\". So there must be a way. So I must be missing something.\\n\\nLet me think again. Maybe using division and multiplication together.\\n\\nFor example, (60 -27) * (25 -21) =33 *4=132. No. But that\\'s not 75.\\n\\nWait, 25 *3=75. How to get 3 from 60,27,21. 27 - (21 - (60/ something)). Let\\'s try:\\n\\n60 / (something) = x. So 27 - (21 -x) =3. So 27 -21 +x=3 →6 +x=3 →x= -3. But 60 divided by something equals -3. So something is -20. But we can\\'t get negative numbers here. So that\\'s not possible.\\n\\nAlternatively, (21 - (60 / something)) =3. So 21 -x=3 →x=18. So 60 divided by something is 18. So something=60/18≈3.333. How to get 3.333 from 27 and 25? 25/ (27 - something). Not sure.\\n\\nAlternatively, (something) divided by 27 gives 3. So something=81. Can we get 81 from 60,25,21? 60 +21=81. Then 81/27=3. Then 25 *3=75. Oh! Wait a minute. That could work.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\nStep 1: 60 +21=81. Now we have 81,27,25.\\n\\nStep 2: 81 /27=3. Now we have 3 and 25.\\n\\nStep 3: 25 *3=75. \\n\\nBut wait, this uses 60,21,27,25 in steps: first combine 60 and21, then combine that result with 27, then combine with 25. But all numbers are used exactly once. Let\\'s check:\\n\\nUsed 60 and 21 in first step. Then used 27 in second step. Then used 25 in third step. All four are used exactly once. Yes! That works.\\n\\nSo the operations would be:\\n\\n60 +21=81\\n\\n81 /27=3\\n\\n3 *25=75\\n\\nYes! That adds up. All numbers used exactly once. Each step involves only two operands. So the solution is:\\n\\nSOLUTION: YES\\n\\nOPERATIONS: [\\'60+21=81\\', \\'81/27=3\\', \\'3*25=75\\']\\n\\nRESULT: 75\\n\\nYes, that works.\\n</think>\\n```\\nSOLUTION: YES\\nOPERATIONS: [\\'60+21=81\\', \\'81/27=3\\', \\'3*25=75\\']\\nRESULT: 75\\n```',\n",

       "\"<think>\\nOkay, so I've got this problem where I need to combine the numbers 70, 63, 75, and 32 using only addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. The goal is to reach exactly 100, and I have to use each number exactly once. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's see how I can approach it.\\n\\nFirst, I think I should list out all the numbers: 70, 63, 75, 32. Maybe I can try different combinations to see which operations get me closer to 100. I remember that sometimes combining larger numbers first can help, but I'm not sure. Let me start by looking at the numbers and seeing which operations might be useful.\\n\\nI notice that 70 and 75 are both large numbers, so maybe adding them would get me somewhere. Let's try 70 + 75. That gives me 145. Hmm, that's way over 100. Maybe I can subtract something from that. But wait, I also have 63 and 32 left. Maybe I can subtract 63 and 32 from 145. Let's see: 145 - 63 = 82, then 82 - 32 = 50. That's too low. So that approach doesn't work.\\n\\nAlright, maybe I should try a different approach. What if I subtract 70 and 63 first? Let's see, 70 - 63 = 7. Then I have 7, 75, and 32 left. Hmm, 7 + 75 = 82, then 82 + 32 = 114. That's over 100. Maybe I can subtract instead. 7 * 75 would be 525, which is way too high. Maybe division? 75 / 7 is about 10.7, which doesn't seem helpful.\\n\\nWait, perhaps I should try combining 75 and 32 first. Let's see, 75 - 32 = 43. Now I have 70, 63, and 43. Maybe 70 + 63 = 133, which is too high. If I subtract 43 from that, 133 - 43 = 90. Close to 100, but not quite. Maybe I can adjust the operations.\\n\\nAnother idea: what if I multiply 70 and 32? 70 * 32 = 2240. That's way too big. Maybe divide instead. 70 / 32 is about 2.1875. Doesn't seem helpful.\\n\\nLet me try combining 63 and 32. 63 + 32 = 95. That's just 5 short of 100. Hmm, if I can add 5 somehow. But where would I get 5 from? I have 70 and 75 left. Maybe 75 - 70 = 5. Oh, that's a thought! So 75 - 70 = 5, and then 95 + 5 = 100. Wait, does that work?\\n\\nLet me check:\\n\\nFirst, combine 63 and 32: 63 + 32 = 95.\\n\\nThen, combine 75 and 70: 75 - 70 = 5.\\n\\nThen, add those two results: 95 + 5 = 100.\\n\\nSo the operations would be:\\n\\n63 + 32 = 95\\n\\n75 - 70 = 5\\n\\n95 + 5 = 100\\n\\nThat seems to use each number exactly once and only uses addition and subtraction. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\\n\\nWait, but does the order matter? Let me see. I used 63 and 32 first, then 75 and 70, and then combined the two results. That should be valid. Each number is used once, and each operation is a single arithmetic step.\\n\\nSo the operations list would be:\\n\\n['63+32=95', '75-70=5', '95+5=100']\\n\\nAnd the result is 100. So the solution is possible.\\n</think>\\n\\nSOLUTION: YES\\nOPERATIONS: ['63+32=95', '75-70=5', '95+5=100']\\nRESULT: 100\""
