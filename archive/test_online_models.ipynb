      "\n",
      "First, I'll list out the numbers: 53, 57, 13, 48. I need to use each one once, so I can't repeat any. I'm a bit overwhelmed because there are so many possible combinations. Maybe I should start by looking for pairs that can be combined to get something useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me consider the largest numbers first. 57 is the biggest, followed by 53. If I subtract 53 from 57, that gives me 4. That's a small number, but maybe useful later. Alternatively, if I subtract 57 from 53, I get -4, which could also be useful, but I'm not sure yet.\n",

      "\n",
      "Another approach: maybe I can combine two numbers to get a result that, when combined with the others, gets me closer to 64. For example, 57 minus 53 is 4, as I thought before. Then, 48 divided by 13 is approximately 3.69. If I multiply 4 by 3.69, that gives around 14.76, which isn't helpful. Maybe if I add them instead? 4 + 3.69 is about 7.69.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps I should try a different pair. Let's try 53 and 13. If I subtract 13 from 53, I get 40. That's a nice number. Then, with 57 and 48, maybe I can do something. If I subtract 48 from 57, that's 9. So now I have 40 and 9. Adding them gives 49, which is 15 less than 64. Hmm, not quite there.\n",

      "Wait, maybe I should look for a way to get 64 by combining operations differently. Let's consider using division to reduce a number. For example, 57 divided by 13 is roughly 4.38. If I multiply that by 48, that's way too big. Alternatively, 48 divided by 13 is about 3.69. Adding that to 57 gives 60.69, which is close to 64. Then, adding 53 would overshoot, but maybe subtracting instead.\n",
