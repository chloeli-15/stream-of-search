Case 1: Jackson is a knight\n   - In this case, Jackson's statement must be true.\n   - Therefore, David cannot be both a knave and a knight simultaneously, which leads to a contradiction.\n2. Case 2: Jackson is a knave\n   - In this case, Jackson's statement must be false.\n   - This means neither of these two conditions for David can hold: \"David is a knave\" or \"David is a knight\".\n3. Combining Cases:\n   - From Case 2, we deduce that neither \"David is a knave\" nor \"David is a knight\" can be true.\n4. Conclusion: Since Jackson's initial statement led us into a logical inconsistency when assuming he was a knight, it implies that he must have been lying.\n5. Thus, Jackson is a knave.\n\nMoving on to David, we analyze his statement: \"If Jackson is a knight then Jackson is a knave.\"\n6. Case 1: Assume Jackson is a knight\n   - According to Jackson's initial statement, if Jackson were a knight, then he would indeed be a knave, which contradicts our assumption (Jackson being a knight).\n7. Case 2: Assume Jackson is a knave\n   - If Jackson is a knave, according to Jackson's initial statement, it would imply that Jackson would not be a knave, leading to a contradiction because we assumed Jackson is a knave.\n8.

This leads to contradiction as it cannot both be true and false simultaneously.\n   - Case 2: If Penelope is a knave (saying Jacob is not a knight), then Jacob must be a knave, which aligns with David lying about Penelope. Now, we have Jacob as a knave, Penelope as a knave, and David as a knave, resulting in all three being knaves.\n\n3. **Exploring Possibilities for David:**\n   - Since David lies when talking about Penelope, if David is a knight, then Penelope must indeed be either a knight or a knave, which contradicts our previous findings where Penelope was revealed to be a knave.\n   - Thus, David must be a knave, meaning his statement: \"Penelope is a knight or Penelope is a knave\" is a lie. Therefore, neither Penelope nor herself can be a knight, leaving us with Jacob and Penelope as knaves.\n\n4. **Exploring Possibilities for Jacob:**\n   - Jacob says David is a knight, but we know from earlier analysis that David is a knave. This implies Jacob's statement is false, so Jacob must be a knave.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Jacob, David, and Penelope are all knaves, while no one else can be confirmed as a knight based on current statements.\n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO, Concluding Resulting People: [], Initial State: ['No Solution']\n```\n",

Therefore, Sophia cannot be a knave.\n\nMoving onto Scarlett\u2019s second statement, \"Scarlett is a knight if and only if James is a knight\":\n- This implies that both Scarlett and James must have the same status (both knights or both knaves).\n- Since we already determined that Sophia is not a knave, Scarlett and James must both be knights for Scarlett's second statement to hold true.\n\nNow considering Sophia\u2019s claim, \"James is a knight\":\n- If James were a knight, according to Scarlett's second statement, both Scarlett and James must be knights, but Scarlett can't be a knave based on her first statement.

Benjamin says, \"Matthew is a knight and Benjamin is a knight.\"\n\nLet's break down these statements step-by-step.\n\n### Analysis of Matthew's Statement:\n- Matthew claims: \"Benjamin is a knave AND Benjamin is a knight\"\n- This implies that both parts must be true simultaneously, which is impossible since no one can be both a knave and a knight at the same time.\n\nSince Matthew's statement leads to an inconsistency, we discard it immediately.\n\n### Moving on to Sofia's Statement:\n- Sofia says: \"If Benjamin is a knave, then Matthew is a knight.\"\n- We need to explore if there exists a scenario where Sofia\u2019s condition holds true, while keeping all other statements valid.\n\n### Exploring Possible Scenarios:\n\n#### Scenario 1: Assume Benjamin is a Knave\n- If Benjamin is a knave, Sofia's statement becomes: \"Not (Knave -> Knight)\"\n- This simplifies to: \"Knave = False\" \u2192 No change\n\nMoving to Matthew's Statement now: \"Knave AND Knight\" cannot both be true, leading to an inconsistency.\n\nNo solution yet, moving to Benjamin's Statement:\n\n- Benjamin says: \"Knight AND Knight\"\n- This simplifies to: \"Knight = True\"\n\nNow, Benjamin is confirmed as a knight.\n\n### Exploring New Situation with Only Benjamin as a Knight:\n- All initial statements reduced to:\n  - Sofia: \"False\" (Simplification)\n  - Matthew: No Action Needed (Explained Already)\n  - Benjamin: \"True\"\n\nMoving to Sofia again:\n- With Benjamin being a knight, Sofia's original statement \"If Benjamin is a knave, then Matthew is a knight\" fails because Benjamin is not a knave.\n\nThis also leads to no consistent outcome.\n\nNext, consider Benjamin alone:\n- Benjamin's statement: \"Knight AND Knight\"\n- Resulting System: [Knight=Yes]\n\nExploring Initial Statements Again:\n- Sofia: \"If Benjamin is a knave, then Matthew is a knight\" fails under any assumption about Benjamin\n- Matthew: No Direct Implication from Benjamin being a knave\n- Benjamin: \"Knight AND Knight\" results in Yes\n\nFinal Resulting State:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Benjamin: Knight",

Combining Daniel's statement: \"Penelope is a knave\" with Penelope's statement: \"Lucas is a knight\", we get: \"If Penelope is a knave, then Lucas is not a knight; if Penelope is a knight, then Lucas is a knight\"\n3. From Lucas's statement combined with Penelope's statement, if Penelope is a knight, then Daniel must also be a knight (because they're equalities)\n4. If Penelope is a knight, Lucas would be a knight as well, contradicting Daniel's initial statement that he can't both be a knight and a knave at the same time\n5. Therefore, Penelope must be a knave\n\n6. Moving on to Daniel's statement: \"Penelope is a knave\" - This is consistent with our previous conclusion that Penelope is indeed a knave\n7. Now, let's focus on Lucas's original statement: \"Daniel is a knight if and only if Penelope is a knight\"\n8.

We'll examine each possible scenario for Henry being either a knight or a knave.\n\n**Case 1: Assume Henry is a Knight**\n- If Henry is a Knight, his statement must hold true. Thus, if he were a Knight, both parts of his statement would have to be consistent with each other. This implies:\n  - If Henry is a Knight, then Avery's statement \"If Henry is a knight, then Henry is a knave\" must also hold true, which means:\n    - Henry cannot be a Knight because it contradicts himself (if Henry is a Knight, he can't say he's a Knight).\n  \n  Moving to the second condition of Matthew's statement, which requires \"If Henry is a knight, then Avery is a knave\", given Henry is a Knight, this leads to a contradiction as well. Hence, Henry cannot be a Knight.\n\n**Case 2: Assume Henry is a Knave**\n- If Henry is a Knave, his statement must be false. Thus, if he were a Knave, both parts of his statement would need to be inconsistent with each other. This implies:\n  - If Henry is a Knave, then the first part of his statement \"If Henry is a knight, then Henry is a knave\" must be false, meaning:\n    - Henry is not a Knave, so he must be a Knight.\n  \n  Next, we look at Matthew's statement, requiring \"If Henry is a knight, then Avery is a knave\". Given that Henry is now identified as a Knight, this condition becomes:\n    - If Henry is a Knight, then Avery must indeed be a Knave.\n    \n  Finally, checking Avery's original statement, which states \"If Henry is a knight, then Henry is a knave\". Since Henry is now confirmed as a Knight, this results in:\n    - Henry cannot be a Knave, hence, it holds true, leaving us with no contradictions.\n\nHence, based on these logical deductions, we conclude:\n- Henry is a Knight\n- Avery is a Knave",

Let's analyze Statement #2: Chloe says \"If Ethan is a knave then Charlotte is a knave\"\n   - If Ethan is a knight, then according to Statement #2, Charlotte must also be a knight.\n   - However, from Operation #0, we know that Chloe cannot be a knight, so Ethan cannot be a knight either.\n3. Since Ethan is neither a knight nor a knave, let's consider his possible states:\n   - Case 1: Ethan is a knave\n     - If Ethan is a knave, then Chloe must be a knight (from Operation #0)\n     - Now, moving to Statement #2: Chloe claims \"If Ethan is a knave then Charlotte is a knave\"\n       - This implies Charlotte must be a knave, but Operation #0 already stated that Chloe is a knight, leading to a contradiction\n     - Therefore, Ethan cannot be a knave\n4.

This leads us to explore further implications.\n\n2. **Exploring Jack's Statement:**\n   - If Jack is telling the truth, then Harper must be a knight (since if Jack were a knight, Harper would have to be a knight).\n   - However, according to Mason, Harper cannot be a knave, which contradicts Jack being truthful about Harper's status.\n\n3. **Exploring Harper's Statement:**\n   - Harper says Jack is a knight or Mason is a knave.\n   - If Mason is a knight, then Harper must be a knave, contradicting Harper's statement.\n   - Thus, Mason must be a knave, making Harper a knight.\n\n4. **Revisiting Mason's Truthful State:**\n   - Since Mason is a knave, Harper must indeed not be a knave. Moving forward, consider Jack's statement again within this context.\n\n5. **Examine Jack's Statement Again:**\n   - If Jack is telling the truth, Harper must be a knight.\n   - But from our current state, Harper is already confirmed as a knight. Therefore, Jack\u2019s original premise about Harpers' identity still holds true, implying that Jack could be either a knight or a knave, but given no contradictions, we need to ensure consistency across all statements.\n\n6. **Consistency Check:**\n   - With Mason as a knave and Harper as a knight, Jack remains neutrally consistent. Let's check if Jack's implication holds:\n     - If Jack is a knight, his statement aligns with Harper being a knight, satisfying Jack\u2019s condition.\n     - If Jack is a knave, his statement becomes irrelevant because it doesn\u2019t involve him directly influencing Harper\u2019s status.\n\n7. **Final Analysis:**\n   - All conditions aligned: Jack can't be both a knight and knave without contradiction.\n   - Resulting Assignments: Jack = Knave, Mason = Knave, Harper = Knight\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\nMoving through each step systematically while maintaining",

Moving on to Liam's statement: \"Ethan is not a knave\", since we've established that Ethan is indeed a knight, this means Liam must be a knave, because knights always tell the truth.\n3. Now focusing on Luke's statement: \"Avery is a knight or Avery is a knave\", since we know from insight #1 that Avery is a knight, this implies that Luke cannot be a knight, thus he must be a knave.\n4. Finally, considering Ethan's original statement combined with Avery's revelation, it becomes evident that Ethan's claim was false, leading us to conclude that Liam is the only remaining true statement-maker, hence he must be a knight.\n\nCONCLUSION: All initial conditions, including the provided statements, have been satisfied, resulting in all four individuals:\n- Liam: Knight\n- Luke: Knave\n- Ethan: Knight\n- Avery: Knight\n\nRESULT: Liam, Ethan, Avery\n```\n",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nassistant```\nMoving on to Ava, her statement implies two scenarios: either she is a knight (in which case, Mason cannot be a knave) or she is a knave (which leads us to explore other possibilities). Let's analyze these cases systematically.\n\n1. **Case 1: Ava is a Knight**\n   - If Ava is a knight, then both Ava and Elizabeth must be knights, otherwise, their statements would contradict each other. Thus, this scenario fails as it results in no contradictions but still not satisfying all initial conditions directly.\n\n2. **Case 2: Ava is a Knave**\n   - If Ava is a knave, we have three remaining possibilities for her status: Elizabeth, Mason, or Abigail being a knight. We will test each possibility:\n\n      - **Subcase 2.1: Ava is a Knave, Elizabeth is a Knight**\n        - Given Ava is a knave, her statement \"Mason is a knave or Ava is a knight\" simplifies to \"Mason is a knave\".\n        - Now, let's check Elizabeth's statement \"Ava is a knight\", which contradicts our assumption that Ava is a knave. Hence, this subcase is invalid.\n\n      - **Subcase 2.2: Ava is a Knave, Mason is a Knight**\n        - Given Ava is a knave, her statement \"Mason is a knave or Ava is a knight\" simplifies to \"Mason is a knave\".\n        - Now, let's check Mason's statement \"Elizabeth is a knight\". Since Ava is a knave, Elizabeth can't be a knight. Thus, this subcase also leads to a contradiction.\n\n      - **Subcase 2.3: Ava is a Knave, Abigail is a Knight**\n        - Given Ava is a knave, her statement \"Mason is a knave or Ava is a knight\" simplifies to \"Mason is a knave\".\n        - Now, let's check Abigail's statement \"If Ava is a knave, then Abigail is a knight\". This is consistent with our current state since Ava is indeed a knave, thus Abigail must be a knight.\n\n    Moving to Ava, now having explored all possible configurations, we find:\n    ```\n    Resulting States:\n    Current State: ['Knights:[Abigail], Knaves:[Elizabeth, Mason]]'\n    Exploring: Ava, Abigail, Mason, Elizabeth,",

Let's start with Ethan: If he's a knight, then Aiden must also be a knight (from his last statement). However, this leads to contradiction since we have no knaves left, which isn't possible.\n\n2. Moving to Aiden: Let's consider him as a knight initially:\n   - Aiden: \"Elizabeth is a knight\" (Knight)\n   - Elizabeth: \"Aiden is a knight or Ethan is a knave\" (Knight, Exploring)\n     Possible scenarios:\n       2a) Aiden=Knight, Ethan=Knave: No Knaves, Contradiction\n       2b) Aiden=Knight, Ethan=Knight: No Solutions\n\n3. Moving to Elizabeth: She can't be a knave because she wouldn't make sense in her own statement. So, let's assume she's a knight:\n   - Elizabeth: \"Aiden is a knight or Ethan is a knave\" (Knight)\n   - Aiden: \"Elizabeth is a knight\" (Knight, Exploring)\n     Possible scenarios:\n       3a) Aiden=Knight, Elizabeth=Knight: No Solutions, Contradiction\n       3b) Aiden=Knight, Elizabeth=Knave: No Solutions\n\n4. Moving back to Aiden: Let's try another initial assumption:\n   - Aiden: \"Elizabeth is a knight or Charlotte is a knave\" (Knight)\n   - Elizabeth: \"Aiden is a knight or Ethan is a knave\" (Knight, Exploring)\n     Possible scenarios:\n       4a) Aiden=Knight, Ethan=Knight: No Solutions\n       4b) Aiden=Knight, Ethan=Knave: No Solutions\n\n5. Moving to Aiden again: Trying different initial assumptions:\n   - Aiden: \"Elizabeth is a knight or Charlotte is a knave\" (Knight)\n   - Aiden: \"Elizabeth is a knight or Ethan is a knave\" (Knight)\n   Combining these, let's explore:\n   - Aiden: \"Elizabeth is a knight\", \"Elizabeth is a knight or Ethan is a knave\"\n   - This simplifies to: \"Ethan is a knave\"\n   - Moving to Ethan: He's a knave, but this conflicts with our previous results.

This means, Joseph can't be a knight, so Joseph must be a knave (because all knaves lie).\n\nWith Joseph being a knave, moving to #3, Mason states Joseph is not a knight, which confirms our previous deduction of Joseph as a knave.\n\nNow, #2, Harper's statement: Scarlet is not a knight, aligns with #4, thus confirming Scarlet is indeed a knave, since she lies about herself.\n\nMoving to #1, Mason's statement: Scarlet is a knave if and only if Harper is a knight. With Scarlet being a knave, for this to hold true, Harper would also have to be a knave (since knaves lie), but we've already established Harper as a knave based on #2, leading to an inconsistency here.\n\nRevisiting #1 again, considering Scarlet as a knave initially, and now Harper as a knave, let's try rearranging: Scarlet is a knave, so Harper cannot be a knight. Given this, let\u2019s explore what happens when Scarlet is a knave:\n\n- If Scarlet is a knave, then according to #1, Harper must also be a knave because Scarlet's truthfulness makes Harper's statement false.\n- Moving to #4, Scarlet being a knave, implies Joseph cannot be a knight, consistent with #3.\n\nMoving to #2, Harper stating Scarlet is not a knight, holds up, no contradictions here.\n\nNow, combining insights: All three: Scarlet, Harper, Joseph are knaves. Only remaining character: Mason\n\nAnalyzing #1: Scarlet, Harper, Joseph are knaves, leaving Mason unaccounted for. However, Mason's original claim involving Scarlet and Harper led to logical inconsistencies, suggesting his statement might not directly point to himself being a knave without additional context or corrections needed.\n\nGiven current analysis, none of the initial assumptions lead to a coherent solution fitting all provided conditions directly. Exploring further logically leads to no viable outcome under existing rules, hence no definite conclusion possible from given information alone.\n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO",

Moving to Aiden's statement: \"David is not a knave\", indicating that David could either be a knight or a knave.

However, this creates an inconsistency, so we must reconsider our initial assumption about Michael.\n\nGiven Michael's original claim, let's re-evaluate: If Michael is a knight, his claim should hold true. Hence, Chloe cannot be a knave, thus she must be a knight.\n\nWith Michael as a knight, Chloe's initial statement holds, implying Michael is a knave, which is consistent.

Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n**Exploring Option #1: 3 of 4 individuals as Knights, 1 as Knave**\n- Let's consider if Olivia can be a Knave: She states: \"If Olivia is a knight then Mia is a knight.\" This implies she cannot be a Knight, so Olivia must be a Knave. Moving forward, we have: [Jackson, Isabella, Mia] as Knights, [Olivia] as Knave.\n- Now, let's check Jackson's assertion: \"Isabella is a knave or Olivia is a knight.\" Since Olivia is a Knave, Isabella must also be a Knave. This leads to a contradiction because Jackson would say, \"Isabella is a knave or Olivia is a knight\", but both sides result in Knave, invaliding Jackson's claim.\n- Next, let's try Isabella being a Knave: Her assertion: \"Jackson is a knave or Mia is a knight.\" Since Isabella is a Knave, Jackson must be a Knight, and Mia must be a Knight. This satisfies her assertion. Moving forward, we have: [Jackson, Isabella, Mia] as Knights, [Olivia] as Knave.\n- Checking Olivia's statement: \"If Olivia is a knight then Mia is a knight.\" This is true, since both Olivia and Mia are Knights, so this holds. Thus, no contradictions here, moving forward.\n- Finally, let's confirm Jackson's original statement: \"Isabella is a knave or Olivia is a knight.\" With Isabella and Olivia both Knaves, this becomes \"Knave or Knave\", resulting in one Knave, consistent with our current state.\n- No Contradictions, Moving Forward\n\n```\nCurrent State: 3K, 1N\nExploring Operation: 3*1",
