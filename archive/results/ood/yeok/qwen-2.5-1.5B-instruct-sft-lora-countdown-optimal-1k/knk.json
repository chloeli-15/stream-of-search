For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nTo determine who is a knight and who is a knave, let's analyze the statements made by Zoey and Oliver.\n\n1. **Zoey's Statement**: \"Oliver is not a knight.\"\n   - If Zoey is a knight (always tells the truth), then Oliver must indeed not be a knight. However, if Zoey is a knave (always lies), then her statement would be false, meaning Oliver could either be a knight or a knave. But since we already know that Oliver cannot be a knight based on our next analysis, Zoey can't be a knave either because it wouldn't contradict any other possible scenarios.\n\n2. **Oliver's Statement**: \"Oliver is a knight if and only if Zoey is a knave.\"\n   - This means two things:\n     - If Zoey is a knight, then Oliver must also be a knight.\n     - If Zoey is a knave, then Oliver must also be a knave.\n   \nGiven these conditions, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n- **Case 1: Zoey is a knight**.\n  - If Zoey is a knight, her statement \"Oliver is not a knight\" would be true. Therefore, Oliver must be a knave.\n  - According to Oliver's statement, since Oliver is a knave (not a knight), his statement becomes irrelevant as it doesn't depend on whether Zoey is a knight or a knave.\n  \n- **Case 2: Zoey is a knave**.\n  - If Zoey is a knave, her statement \"Oliver is not a knight\" would be false. Therefore, Oliver must be a knight.\n  - Oliver's statement says \"Oliver is a knight if and only if Zoey is a knave.\" Since Oliver is a knight and Zoey is a knave, this statement holds true.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we have:\n- **If Zoey is a knight**, Oliver is a knave.\n- **If Zoey is a knave**, Oliver is a knight.\n\nSince one of them must be a knight and the other a knave, we conclude that one person is a knight and the other is a knave.\n\n**Final Result**: \"Oliver is a knight, Zoey is a knave.\"\n\nThus, the final answer in the requested format is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO,\nRESULT: Oliver,knight,Zoey,knave\n```",

So who is a knight and who is a knave?.\nConclude with the final result in EXACTLY this format:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\\ \nRESULT: final_value\n```\nThe final_value should be statements separated by commas. For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Noah and Benjamin based on whether they are knights or knaves.\n\n1. **Noah's Statement:** Noah says \"Benjamin is not a knave.\"\n   - If Noah were a knight (truth-teller), his statement would be true because Benjamin cannot be both a knight and a knave simultaneously.\n   - If Noah were a knave (liar), his statement would be false, meaning Benjamin could either be a knave or a knight. However, since it\u2019s impossible for a person to both be a knave and a knight at the same time, this scenario leads to an internal contradiction. Therefore, Noah must be a knight.\n\n2. **Benjamin's Statement:** Benjamin says \"Noah is a knave if and only if Noah is a knight.\"\n   - Since we have determined that Noah is indeed a knight (from Noah's truthful statement), we can now evaluate Benjamin's statement under this condition.\n   - Benjamin's statement means that if Noah is a knave, then Noah must also be a knave, which contradicts the fact that Noah is actually a knight. Therefore, Benjamin must be a knave.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\\\nRESULT: final_value\n```\n\nSince Noah is a knight and Benjamin is a knave, the final answer is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\\\nRESULT: Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knave, Ethan is a knave.\n```",

Hence, Benjamin\u2019s statement is logically impossible to satisfy under normal conditions.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- Ethan could never say that his own statement is true because his statement itself is false due to Benjamin being a knave.\n- Similarly, Benjamin's statement about Ethan being both a knave and a knight is inherently contradictory and cannot hold true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusions are:\n- Ethan is a knave.\n- Benjamin is a knave.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO/YES/\nRESULT: Benjamin,Ethan\n```",

This means that if Scarlett is a knight, then Charlotte must indeed be a knight.\n   - However, if Scarlett is a knave (always lies), her statement would be false. This means that if Scarlett is a knave, then Charlotte cannot actually be a knight.\n\n2. **Charlotte's Statement**: Charlotte says, \"Scarlett is a knight if and only if Charlotte is a knight.\"\n   - If Charlotte is a knight (always tells the truth), her statement must be true. This means that Scarlet being a knight implies that Charlotte is also a knight.\n   - Conversely, if Charlotte is a knave (always lies), her statement would be false. This means that if Scarlet were a knight, Charlotte would not actually be a knight.\n\nTo resolve this, we need to consider two possible scenarios for each person's identity:\n\n**Scenario 1: Scarlett is a knight**\n- If Scarlett is a knight, then according to her first statement, Charlotte must be a knight as well.\n- According to her second statement, if Scarlett is a knight, then Charlotte must be a knight. This aligns perfectly with Scenario 1 where both Scarlett and Charlotte are knights.\n\n**Scenario 2: Scarlett is a knave**\n- If Scarlett is a knave, then according to her first statement, Charlotte could either be a knight or a knave (because she lies).\n- According to her second statement, if Scarlett is a knave, then Charlotte could still be a knight or a knave, which doesn't contradict anything.\n\nNow let's check Charlotte's statement under these scenarios:\n\n- If Scarlett is a knight:\n  - Both Scarlett and Charlotte must be knights because they both make consistent statements.\n  \n- If Scarlett is a knave:\n  - Charlotte can be either a knight or a knave since her statement about Scarlett is ambiguous based on whether Scarlett is telling the truth or lying.\n  - Her statement does not provide any contradiction when Scarlett is a knave.\n\nGiven these analyses, we conclude that:\n- **Scarlett is a knight**, and\n- **Charlotte is a knave**.\n\nThus, the final result is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\\ \nRESULT: Scarlett,knight, Charlotte,knave\n```",

Therefore, both Elizabeth and Harper cannot simultaneously be knights if Elizabeth is a knight.\n\n#### Case 2: Assume Elizabeth is a knave.\nIf Elizabeth is a knave, her statement must be false.\n\n**Case 2.1: If Harper is a knight.**\n   - If Harper is a knight, his statement that \"Elizabeth is not a knight\" would be true because he is telling the truth.\n   - This is consistent with our assumption that Elizabeth is a knave since if she were telling the truth, then Harper\u2019s statement would be true.\n\n**Case 2.2: If Harper is a knave.**\n   - If Harper is a knave, his statement that \"Elizabeth is not a knight\" would be false because he is lying.\n   - This implies that Elizabeth is actually a knight, which again contradicts our initial assumption of Elizabeth being a knave.\n\nFrom **Case 2**, we find that if Elizabeth is a knave, then Harper must be a knight.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis above:\n- Elizabeth is a knave.\n- Harper is a knight.\n\nThus, the final results are:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nRESULT: knave,knight\n```",

However, for Aiden's statement to be true, both conditions must be met, but since Aiden is a knight, he cannot say it if he is a knight.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\nsystem\nLet's analyze the statements made by Ella and Penelope.\n\n1. **Ella\u2019s Statement:** \"Penelope is a knight if and only if Penelope is a knave.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as two separate conditions: \"If Penelope is a knight, then Penelope is a knave\" and \"If Penelope is a knave, then Penelope is a knight.\"\n\n2. **Penelope\u2019s Statement:** \"If Ella is a knight then Ella is a knave.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as \"If Ella is a knight, then Ella is not a knight,\" which simplifies to \"Ella is not a knight.\"\n\nFrom Penelope\u2019s statement, we know that Ella cannot be a knight (because being a knight would mean she could also be a knave). Therefore, Ella must be a knave.\n\nSince Ella is a knave, her statement \"Penelope is a knight if and only if Penelope is a knave\" must be false. If it were true, Penelope would have to be both a knight and a knave at the same time, which is impossible for a single individual.\n\nGiven that Ella is a knave, let's consider what Penelope might say about Ella being a knight:\n\n- If Penelope said \"Ella is a knight,\" then she would be lying because Ella is indeed a knave.\n- If Penelope said \"Ella is a knave,\" then she would be telling the truth because Ella is indeed a knave.\n\nHowever, since Penelope stated that \"If Ella is a knight then Ella is a knave,\" and knowing that Ella is a knave, Penelope must be a liar. \n\nSo, Penelope is a knave.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Ella is a knave.\n- Penelope is a knave.\n\nThe final result is: \"Knave, Knave.\"",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nLet's analyze the statements made by Samuel and Sofia.\n\n1. **Samuel's Statement**: \"If Samuel is a knight then Sofia is a knight.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as either \"Samuel is a knight and Sofia is a knight\" or \"Samuel is a knight and Sofia is a liar.\"\n\n2. **Sofia's Statement**: \"If Samuel is a knight then Sofia is a knight.\"\n   - This can also be interpreted as either \"Samuel is a knight and Sofia is a knight\" or \"Samuel is a knight and Sofia is a liar.\"\n\n### Case Analysis:\n\n#### Case 1: Both Samuel and Sofia are Knights\n- If both are knights, their statements would mean that if Samuel were a knight, Sofia must also be a knight. But since Samuel said \"if he is a knight then Sofia is a knight,\" this implies that Sofia being a knight is true when Samuel is a knight. Similarly, if Sofia says \"if Samuel is a knight then Sofia is a knight,\" she would be telling the truth because if Samuel is a knight, then Sofia must indeed be a knight. Thus, Samuel and Sofia could all be knights here.\n\n#### Case 2: Both Samuel and Sofia are Liars\n- If both are liars, their statements would contradict each other. Specifically, Samuel's statement \"if Samuel is a knight then Sofia is a knight\" would be false (since Samuel is a liar), meaning that if Samuel were a knight, Sofia would have to be a liar. However, Sofia\u2019s statement \"if Samuel is a knight then Sofia is a knight\" would also be false (since Sofia is a liar), implying that if Samuel were a knight, Sofia would have to be a liar. This creates a contradiction because we assumed both to be liars simultaneously but cannot satisfy both conditions without breaking the logical consistency required for lying scenarios.\n\nSince there is no consistent scenario where both can be knights while maintaining their respective statements, and given the logical inconsistency of Case 2, we must conclude that at least one of them must be a knight.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis above, **one** of them is a knight and the other is a liar. \n\nThus, the solution is:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO/\nRESULT: Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knave, Ethan is a knight.\n```",

This means: \"If Logan is a knight, then Logan is a knave\" translates to \"if L is a knight, then L is a knave.\" Since Avery is a knight, his statement must be true, implying that if Logan is a knight, then Logan must indeed be a knave.\n  \n  - Now, let's check Logan's second part of the statement: \"I am a knight if and only if I am a knave.\"\n    - If Logan is a knight, then his statement is true, meaning \"I am a knight if and only if I am a knave\" is true. But for a knight, \"I am a knight\" is true, so \"I am a knave\" must also be true. Hence, Logan cannot be a knight because being a knight contradicts his statement that he is a knave.\n    - Therefore, Logans statement must be false, which implies that if Logan is a knight, he cannot be a knave. Similarly, if Logan is a knave, his statement becomes true but contradicts the fact that he is a knave.\n\n- **Case 2: Avery is a knave**\n  - If Avery is a knave, then his statement is false.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nystem\nLet's analyze the statements made by Ella and Mason step by step.\n\n1. **Ella's Statement**: \"If Mason is a knight, then Mason is a knave.\"\n   - If Mason is a knight (true), then Mason would be telling the truth about himself being a knave, which contradicts the fact that knights always tell the truth. Therefore, Mason cannot be a knight.\n   - If Mason is a knave (false), then Mason would be lying about his status as a knave. Since he is a knave, it must be true that Mason is a knave. This is consistent because knaves always lie.\n\nSo, based on Ella's statement, Mason must be a knave.\n\n2. **Mason's Statement**: \"Ella is a knight or Ella is a knave.\"\n   - If Ella were a knight, her statement would be false because knights always tell the truth.\n   - If Ella were a knave, her statement would be true because knaves always lie.\n\nSince Mason is a knave, his statement must be false. Therefore, Ella cannot be a knave either; she must be a knight.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude:\n\n- Ella is a knight.\n- Mason is a knave.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO, NO, NO, NO\nRESULT: Ella is a knight, Mason is a knave\n```",

But since knights always tell the truth, Ava must actually be a knave.

However, since Avery is a knave, his statement about Ava being a knave when Avery himself is a knave does not contradict anything. This means Ava could either be a knight or a knave without any logical contradiction from her own statement alone.\n   - The key here is whether Ava can be both a knight and a knave simultaneously. Since the problem states that they are distinct types of people (knights and knaves) and there is no inherent conflict between them, we need to consider their interactions carefully.\n\nSince Avery is a knave, let's evaluate Ava's statement:\n\n- If Ava is a knight, then according to her statement, Avery would have to be a knave, which contradicts our conclusion that Avery is a knave.\n- If Ava is a knave, then her statement holds true, meaning Ava is indeed a knave regardless of Avery's status as a knight or knave.\n\nTherefore, Ava must be a knave.\n\n**Final Result:** Michael is a knave, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knave.\n\n```plaintext\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\\ \nRESULT: Michael,knave,Zoey,knight,Ethan,knave\n```",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsubject\nTo solve this problem, let's analyze the statements made by each inhabitant step by step.\n\n1. **Jack's Statement**: \"James is a knight and Jack is a knight.\"\n   - If Jack were a knight (truth-teller), then both parts of his statement would have to be true. However, if he was lying, both parts of his statement would also be false. But since we don't know yet whether he is telling the truth or not, we can consider two cases for Jack:\n\n   - Case 1: Jack is a knight.\n     - If Jack is a knight, then James must be a knight because \"James is a knight\" is true.\n     - Therefore, Jack cannot be a knight because that would mean James is a knight, but if James is a knight, then Jack cannot be a knight according to his own statement. This creates a contradiction.\n   \n   - Case 2: Jack is a knave.\n     - If Jack is a knave, then his statement is false.\n     - His statement says \"James is a knight and Jack is a knight,\" which means James is a knight and Jack is a knight, contradicting our assumption that Jack is a knave.\n     \n   Since both cases lead to contradictions, we conclude that Jack is a knave.\n\n2. **Sebastian's Statement**: \"Jack is a knave and James is a knave.\"\n   - If Sebastian were a knight (truth-teller), then both parts of his statement would have to be true. However, if he was lying, both parts of his statement would also be false. Again, we need to check both possibilities:\n\n   - Case 1: Sebastian is a knight.\n     - If Sebastian is a knight, then both parts of his statement would have to be true. James being a knave contradicts our assumption that Jack is a knave.\n     \n   - Case 2: Sebastian is a knave.\n     - If Sebastian is a knave, then his statement is false.\n     - His statement says \"Jack is a knave and James is a knave,\" which means both Jack and James are knaves, consistent with us already knowing that Jack is a knave.\n     \n   Since Sebastian's statement fits with Jack being a knave, we accept Sebastian as a knave.\n\n3. **James' Statement**: \"Sebastian is a knight if and only if Sebastian is a knave.\"\n   - If James were a knight (truth-teller), then",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsubject\nLet's analyze the information given step-by-step:\n\n1. **Penelope says:** \"Jacob is a knight.\"\n2. **David says:** \"Penelope is a knight or Penelope is a knave.\"\n3. **Jacob says:** \"David is a knight.\"\n\nWe need to determine if any of them are knights (who always tell the truth) or knaves (who always lie).\n\n### Analysis of Statements\n\n#### Case 1: Assume Penelope is a knight.\n\n- If Penelope is a knight, her statement must be true. Therefore, Jacob must also be a knight because \"Jacob is a knight\" is true.\n  \n  - If Jacob is a knight, his statement about David being a knight must be true. Therefore, David must also be a knight.\n  \n  This means we have two knights and one knave. But since there are three people, this scenario cannot hold because it would imply at least two people are lying, which contradicts the assumption that all are either knights or knaves.\n\n#### Case 2: Assume Penelope is a knave.\n\n- If Penelope is a knave, her statement must be false. Therefore, Jacob must not be a knight, so he must be a knave.\n  \n  Now, let\u2019s check the other statements based on this new information:\n    - **David's statement**: \"Penelope is a knight or Penelope is a knave.\" Since Penelope is a knave, this becomes \"Knave is a knight,\" which is false. Hence, David must be a knave as well.\n  \n  We now have three knaves, but again, this does not fit the condition of having exactly two knights and one knave.\n\nSince both cases lead to contradictions when assuming Penelope is either a knight or a knave, none of these assumptions can be correct.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven that neither Penelope nor anyone else could logically maintain their claims while adhering strictly to the conditions of knights (always telling the truth) and knaves (always lying), we conclude that no one fits the criteria of being a knight or knave under the provided statements.\n\n**Final Result:** NO/NO/NO",

This contradicts itself because it states that a knight cannot simultaneously be both a knave and a knight at the same time. Therefore, Jackson must be a liar (knight).\n   \n   - **Jackson**: \"Aurora is a knight\"\n     - Since we already determined that Jackson is a liar, his statement must be false. Hence, Aurora is not a knight.\n\n   - **Ethan**: \"Aurora is a knight\" AND \"Ethan is a knave and Aurora is a knave\"\n     - Since we know from earlier that Aurora is not a knight, Ethan\u2019s first part (\"Aurora is a knight\") is false. Now let's look at the second part: \"Ethan is a knave and Aurora is a knave.\" Since Aurora is not a knight, Ethan could either be a knave or a knight. However, since Ethan said \"Ethan is a knave and Aurora is a knave\", he cannot be a knight (because if he were, his statement would be true, which is impossible since he is lying).\n\n2. **Conclusion:**\n   - **Jackson** is a knight.\n   - **Aurora** is a knave.\n   - **Ethan** is a knave.\n\nSo, the final result is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES  \nRESULT: Jackson,knight,Aurora,knave,Ethan,knave\n```",

Hence, Penelope cannot be a knight.\n\n#### Case 2: Assume Penelope is a Knave\nIf Penelope is a knave, her statement must be false. Therefore, Lucas cannot be a knave nor can he be a knight.

This implies that Owen is not a knave when Jacob is a knave, which is consistent with Harper being a knave.\n\nNow let's combine these possibilities:\n\n- From Owen's statement, if he is a knight, then Jacob must be a knave.\n- From Harper's statement, since Owen is a knave when Jacob is a knave, Harper cannot be a knight (because she would contradict herself).\n\nTherefore, if Owen is a knight, then Jacob must be a knave as well. But this creates a contradiction because it says both Jacob and Owen are knights, which is impossible according to their individual statements.\n\nSo, the only consistent scenario is:\n- Owen is a knight.\n- Jacob is a knave.\n- Harper is a knave.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n```\nYES/O/NK/KN/KN\n```",

So who is a knight and who is a knave?.\nConclude with the final result in EXACTLY this format:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\\ \nRESULT: final_value\n```\nThe final_value should be statements separated by commas. For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nystem\nLet's analyze the statements made by each inhabitant step-by-step:\n\n1. **Grace says:** \"Joseph is a knave or Mason is a knight.\"\n2. **Joseph says:** \"Grace is a knight or Joseph is a knight.\"\n3. **Mason says:** \"Joseph is a knight.\"\n\nWe need to determine who among Grace, Joseph, and Mason is a knight and who is a knave.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### Grace's Statement:\nGrace claims that either Joseph is a knave (K) or Mason is a knight (K).\n\nIf Grace were a knight, her statement would be true if Joseph is a knave (K), and Mason is a knight (K). However, if she were a knave, her statement would be false because it would imply both Joseph and Mason are not knights, which contradicts the possibility of one being a knight.\n\nSo, Grace must be a knight if her statement is true. If she is a knave, then her statement would be false, meaning at least one of Joseph or Mason is a knight, but this does not directly help us identify them as knights or knaves without more information.\n\n#### Joseph's Statement:\nJoseph says that either Grace is a knight (K) or Joseph is a knight (K).\n\nAgain, if Joseph were a knight, his statement would be true regardless of Grace's status. If he were a knave, his statement would be false, implying both Grace and Joseph are not knights, again contradicting the possibility of Joseph being a knave.\n\nSo, Joseph must also be a knight if his statement is true. If he is a knave, then his statement would be false, meaning neither Grace nor Joseph are knights, but this scenario doesn't align well with Joseph saying he himself is a knight, so we infer Joseph must be a knight.\n\n#### Mason's Statement:\nMason says that Joseph is a knight.\n\nIf Mason were a knight, his statement would be true if Joseph is indeed a knight (K). If Mason were a knave, his statement would be false, meaning Joseph is not a knight (K).\n\nSince Joseph has been established as a knight based on Grace\u2019s and Joseph\u2019s statements, Mason cannot be a knave because then his statement would be false. Therefore, Mason must be a knight.\n\nNow, let's summarize the findings:\n- Grace is a knight (since her statement was true).\n- Joseph is a knight (as determined from Grace's and Joseph's statements).\n-",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by each inhabitant and determine their logical consistency.\n\n1. **Ethan's Statement**: Ethan said, \"Emily is a knight and Mia is a knight.\"\n2. **Mia's Statement**: Mia said, \"Emily is not a knave.\"\n3. **Emily's Statement**: Emily said, \"Mia is a knave if and only if Emily is a knight.\"\n\nWe will use these statements to deduce who is a knight and who is a knave.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze Ethan's Statement\n- If Ethan is telling the truth, then both Emily and Mia must be knights (since they both stated that Emily is a knight).\n- If Ethan is lying, then at least one of them must be a knave.\n\nSince there can only be two knights among the three, it is impossible for all three to be knights because it would mean Ethan is lying about both conditions being true simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, Ethan cannot be a knight. This means he must be a knave.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze Mia's Statement\n- If Mia is telling the truth, then Emily is indeed a knight.\n- If Mia is lying, then Emily is not a knight.\n\nIf Mia is telling the truth, then Emily is a knight, which contradicts our earlier conclusion that Ethan is a knave.\n\nThus, Mia must be lying. Since Mia is lying, Emily is not a knight.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze Emily's Statement\n- Emily states, \"Mia is a knave if and only if Emily is a knight.\"\n\nThis statement implies two things:\n1. If Emily is a knight, then Mia must be a knave.\n2. If Emily is a knave, then Mia must be a knight.\n\nHowever, since Emily is not a knight from our previous analysis, her statement cannot be true.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsubject\nLet's analyze each statement step-by-step to determine who is a knight and who is a knave.\n\n1. **Statement of Matthew:** \"Matthew is a knight if and only if Chloe is a knave.\"\n2. **Statement of Noah:** \"Noah is a knight if and only if Matthew is a knight.\"\n3. **Statement of Chloe:** \"If Matthew is a knight then Noah is a knight.\"\n\nFirstly, let's consider the logical implications of these statements:\n\n- If Matthew is a knight, then Chloe must also be a knight (because \"if and only if\" means both conditions must hold).\n- If Matthew is a knave, then Chloe must be a knave (because \"if and only if\" means both conditions must hold).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each scenario:\n\n### Scenario 1: Assume Matthew is a knight.\n- If Matthew is a knight, then according to the first statement, Chloe must also be a knight.\n- According to the second statement, since Matthew is a knight, Noah must also be a knight.\n- According to the third statement, since Matthew is a knight, Noah would indeed be a knight.\n  \nIn this case, all three individuals\u2014Matthew, Noah, and Chloe\u2014are knights.\n\n### Scenario 2: Assume Matthew is a knave.\n- If Matthew is a knave, then according to the first statement, Chloe must be a knave.\n- According to the second statement, since Matthew is a knave, Noah must also be a knave.\n- According to the third statement, since Matthew is a knave, Noah would not be a knight, which contradicts our assumption that Noah is a knave. Therefore, this scenario leads to a contradiction.\n\nSince assuming Matthew is a knave results in a contradiction, we can conclude that Matthew cannot be a knave.\n\nGiven that Matthew is a knight, based on our earlier analysis:\n- Chloe must also be a knight (since \"if and only if\" holds true when Matthew is a knight).\n- Noah must also be a knight (as per the second statement).\n\nSo, all three individuals are knights.\n\n**Final Result:**\n```\nYES/NO,\nresult: Michael is a knight, Zoe is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.\n```",

However, this creates a contradiction since we already assumed Abigail was a knave based on Alexander\u2019s statement.\n\n3. **Abigail's statement**: \"Chloe is a knave.\"\n   - If Abigail is a knight, she would be telling the truth, which implies Chloe is indeed a knave. But if Abigail is a knave, she is lying about Chloe being a knave, making her assertion false, implying that Chloe is actually a knight. \n\nGiven these contradictions, let's re-evaluate:\n\n- Assume Chloe is a knight.

However, since Avery is a knight, his statement must be true. Therefore, Aria cannot be a knight because if she were, Harper would indeed be a knave, making Avery's statement false. Hence, Aria must be a knave (\\( P = F \\)).\n   - Now, the implication becomes \\( F \\rightarrow Q \\). Since \\( Q \\) is also false (because Aria is a knave), the implication holds true regardless of what \\( Q \\) is.\n\n2. **Aria says**: \"Avery is a knave if and only if Aria is a knight.\"\n   - This can be written as \\( P \\leftrightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) means \"Avery is a knave\" and \\( Q \\) means \"Aria is a knight\".\n   - If Aria were a knight (\\( Q = T \\)), then according to the rule of equivalence, we would have \\( P = F \\). However, since Aria is a knave (\\( Q = F \\)), her statement must be true. Therefore, Avery cannot be a knave because if he were, Aria would be a knight, which contradicts her being a knave.\n   - Now, the equivalence becomes \\( F \\leftrightarrow Q \\). Since \\( Q \\) is false (because Aria is a knave), the implication does not hold true unless \\( Q \\) is true, but it is false here.

Therefore, if Aurora is a knight, Charlotte must be a knave.\n\n2. **Consider Noah's statement**:\n   - If Noah is a knight, then his statement (\"Charlotte is a knight or Aurora is a knight\") must be false. Since Charlotte is a knave (from step 1), her statement (\"Noah is a knight or Noah is a knight\") is also false because it would imply both statements about Noah being true, but since she is a knave, her statement is a lie. Thus, Noah cannot be a knight.\n\n3. **Determine Noah's role**:\n   - Since Noah cannot be a knight, he must be a knave. Now let's check Noah's statement again: \"Charlotte is a knight or Noah is a knight\". As we have established, Charlotte is a knave, so her statement is a lie. The correct interpretation of Noah\u2019s statement as a liar means both parts must be false: \"Charlotte is not a knight\" and \"Noah is not a knight\", making Noah indeed a knave consistent with the scenario.\n\n4. **Determine Aurora's role**:\n   - We already deduced from Noah that Charlotte is a knave.

This implies that either Jackson or Liam must not be a knight (which contradicts our assumption). Therefore, this case leads to a contradiction because if Liam is a knave, Jackson cannot say he is a knave, as he is already stating that Liam is a knave.\n\nThus, **Liam cannot be a knave**.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nTo solve this problem, let's analyze the given information step-by-step.\n\n1. **Avery mentions:**\n   \"William is not a knave.\"\n\n2. **William's statement:**\n   \"William is a knight if and only if Sebastian is a knight.\"\n   \n3. **Sebastian's statement:**\n   \"Sebastian is a knight if and only if Avery is a knight.\"\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Avery's Statement\n\n- Avery believes that William is not a knave.\n- If Avery were lying (i.e., William is a knave), then his statement would be false.\n- Since William is not a knave according to Avery, Avery must be telling the truth about him being truthful.\n  \nSo far, we have two possibilities for William:\n- **Case 1:** William is a knight.\n- **Case 2:** William is a knave.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze William's Statement\n\n- If William is a knight, his statement is true.\n- Therefore, William must be a knight because he is stating that he is a knight.\n  \nThus, from Case 1 of William\u2019s statement, we conclude:\n\n**Case 1: William is a knight.**\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Consistency of the Statements\n\n- **If William is a knight:**\n  - Avery's statement is true (since William is a knight).\n  - According to William's statement, \"William is a knight if and only if Sebastian is a knight.\" This is consistent since William is indeed a knight.\n\n- **If William is a knave:**\n  - Avery's statement becomes false because William is actually a knave.\n  - However, William\u2019s statement \"William is a knight if and only if Sebastian is a knight\" cannot be true since both William and Sebastian are knaves, making their statements contradictory.\n\nTherefore, based on these deductions, we can conclude:\n\n**William is a knight, and Avery is also a knight.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/\nRESULT: William, Avery\n```",

Therefore:\n- Olivia is a knight (\\(O = T\\))\n- Sebastian is also a knight (\\(S = T\\))\n\nSubstituting these values into Sebastian's statement:\n- Sebastian's statement says: \"Olivia is a knight or Chloe is a knave\" becomes \\(T \\lor K\\) where \\(K\\) means \"Chloe is a knave\".\nSince Olivia is a knight, \\(T\\) is true. Therefore, for Sebastian\u2019s statement to be consistent with Olivia being a knight, it must mean that \\(T\\) (which is true) is true, making \\(K\\) false, meaning Chloe is not a knave. However, since we assumed Olivia is a knight, she cannot make a false claim about herself, so this case does not hold because it would lead to contradictory information if we assume Olivia is a knight.\n\n#### Case 2: Assume Olivia is a Knave\nIf Olivia is a knave, then her statement is false. Therefore:\n- Olivia is a knight (\\(O = F\\))\n- Sebastian is also a knave (\\(S = F\\))\n\nSubstituting these values into Sebastian's statement:\n- Sebastian's statement says: \"Olivia is a knight or Chloe is a knave\" becomes \\(F \\lor K\\). Since Olivia is a knave, her part of the statement is false. Thus, for Sebastian\u2019s statement to be consistent with his own being a knave, it must mean that \\(F\\) (false) is true when combined with \\(K\\) (true), leading to contradiction unless \\(K\\) is false, implying Chloe is a knight (\\(K = T\\)).\n\nTherefore, given that Sebastian is a knave:\n- Olivia is a knave (\\(O = F\\))\n- Sebastian is a knave (\\(",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nTo solve this problem, let's analyze the statements made by each inhabitant step by step:\n\n1. **Noah**: \"Abigail is not a knight.\"\n   - If Noah were telling the truth, then Abigail would indeed be a knave (since knights always tell the truth).\n   - However, if Noah is lying, then Abigail must be a knight.\n\n2. **Henry**: \"Abigail is a knave and Abigail is a knight.\"\n   - This statement is contradictory because it says both \"Abigail is a knave\" and \"Abigail is a knight.\"\n\n3. **Abigail**: \"Noah is a knave and Henry is a knight.\"\n   - If Abigail were telling the truth, then both Noah and Henry would be knaves.\n   - But if Abigail is lying, then at least one of them is a knight.\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n### Scenario Analysis\n\n#### Case 1: Assume Noah is a knight.\n- If Noah is a knight, his statement \"Abigail is not a knight\" must be true.\n- Therefore, Abigail is a knave.\n\nNow we have:\n- Noah is a knight.\n- Abigail is a knave.\n\nSince Noah is a knight, he cannot be lying about Abigail being a knave. Thus, Noah\u2019s statement holds true, and no contradiction arises here.\n\nNext, let's look at Henry's statement:\n- Henry claims \"Abigail is a knave and Abigail is a knight.\"\n- As established earlier, Abigail is a knave. Henry's second part contradicts himself, as he can't simultaneously claim she is both a knave and a knight.\n\nThis scenario is inconsistent because Henry's first part (\"Abigail is a knave\") aligns with our previous finding, but Henry's second part leads to a logical inconsistency.\n\n#### Case 2: Assume Noah is a knave.\n- If Noah is a knave, his statement \"Abigail is not a knight\" must be false.\n- Therefore, Abigail must be a knight.\n\nNow we have:\n- Noah is a knave.\n- Abigail is a knight.\n\nFor Henry's statement:\n- Henry claims \"Abigail is a knave and Abigail is a knight.\"\n- Since Abigail is a knight, Henry's first part (\"Abigail is a knave\") must be false, which means Abigail is actually a knight.\n\nThis scenario is consistent:\n- Noah is a knave",

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsubject\nLet's analyze the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Matthew's statement**: If Jackson is a knight, then Joseph is a knave. If Jackson is a knave, then Joseph is a knight.\n2. **Joseph's statement**: If Jackson is a knight, then Matthew is a knave. If Jackson is a knave, then Matthew is a knight.\n3. **Jackson's statement**: If Matthew is a knave, then Joseph is a knight. If Matthew is a knight, then Joseph is a knave.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### Case 1: Assume Jackson is a knight\n- According to Matthew's statement if Jackson is a knight, Joseph must be a knave.\n- According to Joseph's statement if Jackson is a knight, Matthew must be a knave.\n- This contradicts itself because Matthew cannot both be a knave (lying) and also state that Joseph is a knave (telling the truth).\n\nSo, Jackson cannot be a knight.\n\n#### Case 2: Assume Jackson is a knave\n- According to Matthew's statement if Jackson is a knave, Joseph must be a knight.\n- According to Joseph's statement if Jackson is a knave, Matthew must be a knight.\n- Both of these statements align correctly with each other and with their own consistency checks without contradiction.\n\nThus, Jackson can be either a knight or a knave but not both simultaneously based on his initial statement being false.\n\nSince we need a definitive solution, let\u2019s consider the implications:\n\n**Case 2 Confirmation:** Given Jackson as a knave, Matthew's true belief would make Joseph a knight since Joseph\u2019s statement matches reality given that Matthew is indeed a knight (which it seems to be from our analysis). Therefore, Joseph could be a knight.\n\nNow we have:\n- Jackson = Knave\n- Matthew = Knight\n- Joseph = Knight\n\nThis configuration satisfies all statements:\n- Matthew says: \"If Jackson is a knight, then Joseph is a knave.\" True.\n- Matthew says: \"If Jackson is a knight, then Jackson is a knave.\" False.\n- Joseph says: \"If Jackson is a knight, then Matthew is a knave.\" False.\n- Joseph says: \"If Jackson is a knave, then Matthew is a knight.\" True.\n\nTherefore, the final result is:\n\n```\nYES/NO\\ \nRESULT: Joseph,Knight,Mattthew,Knave\n```",

Therefore, Harper cannot be a knave.\n- Jack\u2019s statement would then be false because it implies that if Jack is a knight, Harper is also a knight, which contradicts our assumption that Harper is not a knave.\n- However, Jack could still be a knight if he is telling the truth about himself being a knight, but this creates a contradiction since we assumed Mason was truthful. Thus, Mason cannot be a knight.\n\n#### Case 2: Assume Mason is a knave.\n- If Mason is a knave, his statement \"Harper is not a knave\" must be false. Therefore, Harper is a knave.\n- Jack\u2019s statement now becomes: \"If Jack is a knight, then Harper is a knave,\" which means Jack cannot be a knight because if he were, Harper would indeed be a knave, making the entire implication false.\n- This aligns with the fact that Jack can't be a knight and Harper is already known to be a knave. Therefore, Jack must be a knave as well.\n\n#### Case 3: Assume Harper is a knight.\n- If Harper is a knight, her statement \"Jack is a knight or Mason is a knave\" must be true.\n- Since Mason is either a knight or a knave, if Mason is a knight, then Jack and Harper cannot both be knights, leading to a contradiction.\n- Therefore, Mason must be a knave, making Jack a knight.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Mason is a knave.\n- Jack is a knight.\n- Harper is a knight.\n\nThus, the final result is:\n```\nYES/NO,\nRESULT: knight,knight,knave\n```",

This implies that Chloe cannot be a knave.\n   - If Charlotte is a knave, then \"Chloe is not a knave\" must be false because knaves always lie. Therefore, Chloe could either be a knight or a knave.\n\n2. **Zoey's Statement**: \"Charlotte is a knave if and only if Zoey is a knight.\"\n   - If Zoey is a knight, then Charlotte must also be a knave (because \"if and only if\" means both conditions are equivalent). However, we already know from Charlotte's statement that if Zoey is a knight, Chloe cannot be a knave. This creates a contradiction because if Zoey is a knight, then Charlotte would have to be a knave, but then \"Chloe is not a knave\" would be false, which contradicts Charlotte being a knight. Therefore, Zoey cannot be a knight.\n   - Since Zoey is not a knight, her statement \"Charlotte is a knave if and only if Zoey is a knight\" becomes irrelevant as it is about an impossible scenario (Zoey is not a knight).\n\n3. **Chloe's Statement**: \"Zoey is a knight or Chloe is a knight.\"\n   - If Zoey is a knight, then \"Zoey is a knight or Chloe is a knight\" is true because it includes Zoey herself.\n   - If Zoey is a knave, then \"Zoey is a knight or Chloe is a knight\" would be false because a knave always lies, meaning \"Zoey is a knight\" is false, so \"or\" clause becomes false.\n\nNow let's consider the possibilities:\n\n- If Zoey is a knight, then \"Chloe is a knave\" is true according to Charlotte, but this contradicts our earlier conclusion that \"Zoey is a knight or Chloe is a knight\" should be true. Therefore, Zoey cannot be a knight.\n- The only remaining possibility is that Zoey is a knave, which makes \"Chloe is a knave\" false.

Thus, if Samuel is telling the truth about Sebastian not being a knave, then Logan must be a knight. Conversely, if Samuel is lying about Sebastian not being a knave, then Logan must be a knave.\n\n- Since Jacob claims Logan is a knight from his own statement, and we've established that Samuel can't both be a knight and a liar simultaneously due to the contradiction between their roles, we conclude:\n  - Samuel is lying because if he was telling the truth, it would mean Sebastian is a knave, which contradicts the fact that Samuel lied about it.\n  - Therefore, Samuel is a knave.\n\nGiven that Samuel is a knave, we now look at Logan's claim. Since Samuel lied, it follows that Logan must be telling the truth, so Logan is a knight.\n\nSince Logan is a knight, his statement matches with Jacob's assertion that Logan is a knight, confirming Jacob's correctness as well.\n\nFinally, we need to determine Sebastian.

Hence, Charlotte cannot be a knight. \n\nFrom \\(C \\leftrightarrow M\\), if Charlotte is not a knight, then Matthew must also not be a knight because they are equivalent states.\n\nNow let's consider Avery's statement. Since \\(C \\neq K\\) (Charlotte is not a knight), it follows that \\(P \\rightarrow K\\) does not hold true either because if Penelope is a knave, then \\(K\\) would be false, making the implication false regardless of the value of \\(P\\). However, for \\(P \\rightarrow K\\) to be valid, \\(P\\) must be true (penelope is a knave) or \\(K\\) must be true (charlotte is a knight), but given our analysis above, Charlotte is not a knight, so \\(K\\) must be false.\n\nTherefore, Avery's statement \\(P \\rightarrow K\\) must be true because \\(P\\) (being a knave) makes the implication valid when combined with \\(K\\) (not being a knight).\n\nThis leads us to conclude that Avery is a knave.\n\nSince Avery is a knave, his statement \\(P \\rightarrow K\\) holds true even though he himself is a knave, which contradicts the requirement that all",

Therefore, Scarlet claims that if she were a knight, Mason would be a knight, which matches Sebastian's statement where it implies Sebastian being a knight when Mason is a knave.\n\n- Given Scarlett is a knight, her statement holds true under any condition of Mason\u2019s identity (knave or knight).\n\n- From Mason's statement, we know that Joseph is not a knave, meaning Joseph could be a knight or a knave.\n\n- Sebastian's statement implies that if Mason is a knave, Sebastian must be a knight. However, if Mason is a knight, Sebastian would have to be a knight regardless of his own identity status.\n\n- We now need to consider Joseph's identity.

Hence, there's no contradiction here.\n  \n  - Thus, Jack is a knight, Oliver is a knight, Amelia is a knave, and Grace could be a knight or a knave.\n\n- Suppose Jack is a knave.

Therefore, Samuel must be a knight.\n- With Samuel as a knight, he cannot be lying, so his statement \"Jackson is a knave\" must also be true.\n- Finally, look at Jackson's statement: \"If Emily is a knave then Liam is a knave.\"\n  - Since we already know Samuel is a knight, which means Emily cannot be a knave, Jackson's statement becomes false, implying Liam is not a knave. But this conflicts with our previous finding that Liam is a knight because Liam would contradict himself if both parts were simultaneously true.\n\nThus, assuming Liam is a knight leads to a contradiction. Hence, Liam cannot be a knight.\n\n#### Case 2: Assume Samuel is a knight.\n- From Samuel's statement: \"Jackson is a knave.\"\n  - If Samuel is a knight, his statement must be true, so Jackson is indeed a knave.\n- Now consider Emily's statement: \"Samuel is a knight or Emily is a knight.\"\n  - Since Samuel is a knight, this statement holds true, confirming Samuel is a knight.\n- Look at Jackson's statement: \"If Emily is a knave then Liam is a knave.\"\n  - Since Emily is a knight and Jackson is a knave, Jackson's statement becomes false, meaning Liam must be a knight.\n- Finally, check Liam's statement: \"If Samuel is a knave then Emily",

Hence, this case leads to contradiction.\n\n2. **Case 2:** Assume Luke is a knave.\n   - Then his statement (\"If Isabella is a knave then Luke is a knight\") becomes a lie.\n     - Thus, if Isabella is a knave, Luke will say she is a knave, which matches the description.\n   - If Isabella is a knight, according to his rule, he would also lie, leading to a contradiction.\n\nSo, **Luke** must be a knave.\n\n#### Conclusion for Isabella:\nFrom the analysis of Luke\u2019s statement:\n- Since Luke is a knave, his statement \u201cIf Isabella is a knave then Luke is a knight\u201d is a lie, so Isabella can\u2019t be a knave (otherwise her statement would align correctly).\n\nThus, Isabella must be a knight.\n\n#### Verification through Aurora\u2019s Statement:\n- Aurora states: \"Isabella is a knight and Isabella is a knave.\"\n- This directly contradicts our previous conclusion since neither part can hold true unless there's an error in assumption, but we've already established that Isabella",

If Lily is telling the truth, then both statements must be true:\n   - Lily is a knight (which means her first part is true).\n   - Henry is a knave (which means his second part is false). However, if Henry were a knave, he would also say his own statement is false, which means he lies about being a knave. This creates a contradiction because Henry cannot simultaneously be a knave and say he is not a knave.\n\n2. **Henry's Statement:** Henry says Avery is a knave. Since Henry is lying, Avery must actually be a knight, but this contradicts Henry's statement that Avery is a knave.\n\n3. **Owen's Statement:** Owen says \"If Henry is a knight then Henry is a knave.\" Since Owen is lying, this implies:\n   - Henry is not a knave (otherwise, the statement would be true).\n   - Henry is a knight (otherwise, the statement would be false).\n\nFrom these contradictions, it seems there might be an error in the initial setup or interpretation.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsubject\nLet's analyze each statement step by step to determine who is a knight and who is a knave.\n\n1. **Samuel's Statement**: \"Aiden is a knight if and only if Alexander is a knight.\"\n   - If Aiden is a knight (truth-teller), then Alexander must also be a knight (since they are both knights).\n   - If Aiden is a knave (liar), then Alexander must be a knight (to maintain consistency).\n\n2. **James' Statement**: \"If Alexander is a knight then Alexander is a knave.\"\n   - This implies that either Alexander is a knight or a knave.\n   - If Alexander is a knight, then according to James, he would have to be a knave (which contradicts his own statement). Therefore, Alexander cannot be a knight.\n\n3. **Alexander's Statement**: \"Aiden is not a knight.\"\n   - Since we concluded that Alexander cannot be a knight from James' statement, Alexander must be a knave.\n\n4. **Aiden's Statement**: \"If Samuel is a knight then Alexander is a knight.\"\n   - Since Alexander is a knave, this statement becomes false because Alexander cannot be a knight.\n   \nNow let's summarize our findings:\n\n- Alexander is a knave.\n- We need to check Samuel's statement under these conditions.\n\nSince Alexander is a knave, there is no direct information about Samuel's statement being true or false based on Alexander's status. However, since Alexander is a knave, it means his statement might be lying.\n\n5. **Samuel's Statement**:\n   - If Alexander were a knight, Samuel's statement would be true, but we know Alexander is a knave.\n   - Thus, Samuel must be a knight.\n\nSo, we conclude:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES  \nRESULT: Michael, Zoe, Ethan",

We need to check his statement: \"**Owen is a knave**\" (which we already know is true because Owen is a knave).

Therefore, Chloe must be a knight.\n\n#### Statement 2: Noah's Statement\n- If Sophia is a knave (which we know from Sophia's first statement), then Chloe cannot be a knave.\n- This directly contradicts Noah's statement (\"If Sophia is a knave then Chloe is a knave\"). Hence, Sophia cannot be a knave.\n\nSince Sophia cannot be a knave, she must be a knight. Given this, let's re-evaluate Noah's statement under Sophia being a knight:\n\n- If Sophia is a knight, Chloe must be a knave.\n- Noah's statement (\"If Sophia is a knave then Chloe is a knave\") would be false because it relies on Sophia being a knave, which we have established does not happen since Sophia is a knight.\n\nThus, Noah\u2019s statement is true under the assumption that Sophia is a knight.\n\n#### Statement 3: Daniel's Statement\n- If Chloe were a knight, Daniel would be a knight because he claims Chloe is not a knight.\n- However, we already determined that Chloe must be a knave (from Sophia's first statement).\n- Therefore, Daniel cannot be a knight. Since Daniel is not a knight, his claim about Chloe being not a knight is irrelevant for determining whether Daniel is a knight or a knave.\n\n#### Statement 4: Chloe's Statement\n- If Noah is a knight (and we've concluded he is based on Noah's truthfulness), then Sophia must also be a knight (since they're connected through \"Noah is a knave if and only if Sophia is a knight\").\n- But we've already established that Sophia is a knight, so Noah is indeed a knight, and therefore Chloe cannot be",

Let's analyze their statements step-by-step:\n\n1. **Jack's Statement:** \"Isabella is a knave or Emma is a knave.\"\n2. **Isabella's Statement:** \"Ella is not a knave.\"\n3. **Ella's Statement:** \"Isabella is a knave or Emma is a knight.\"\n4. **Emma's Statement:** \"Emma is a knight.\"\n\nSince knights always tell the truth and knaves always lie, we can evaluate each statement based on the possible identities of the individuals.\n\nLet's start by considering the possibilities for Emma:\n- If Emma is a knight, then her statement (\"Emma is a knight\") must be true. This means Emma is indeed a knight.\n- If Emma is a knave, then her statement must be false. However, since Emma cannot both be a knave and a knight at the same time, there is no way she could make such a contradictory claim if she were a knave. Therefore, Emma cannot be a knave.\n\nSo far, we have determined that Emma must be a knight.\n\nNow let\u2019s consider Jack's statement:\n- Since Emma is a knight, Jack's statement \"Isabella is a knave or Emma is a knave\" would imply that Isabella is a knave because Emma is a knight.\n- If Jack is telling the truth, then Isabella must be a knave. This aligns with our earlier conclusion that Emma is a knight.\n\nNext, let's look at Isabella's statement:\n- Since Isabella is a knave, Isabella\u2019s statement \"Ella is not a knave\" must be false. This means Ella is a knave as well.\n\nFinally, let's examine Ella's statement:\n- Since Ella is a knave, Ella's statement \"Isabella is a knave or Emma is a knight\" must be false. This implies that Isabella is not a knave and Emma is not a knight.\n\nWe now know:\n- Emma is a knight,\n- Isabella is a knave,\n- Ella is a knave,\n- Jack is a knight.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\\\nRESULT: Jack,knight,Ellam,Knave,Emma,Knave,Jack,Knave,Ella,Knave\n```",

Since Sebastian can't know for sure whether Noah is a knight or a liar based on his statement alone, we don't have enough information to determine Sebastian's identity from this statement.\n\n**Lucas:** If Daniel were a knight (truth-teller), then Daniel would be telling the truth when he says \"Noah is a knave.\" If Daniel were a liar (knight), he would be lying when he says \"Noah is a knave\" because knaves always lie. Again, we lack sufficient information about Daniel's identity to definitively state whether he is a knight or a liar based solely on Lucas's statement.\n\n**Daniel:** If Noah were a knight (truth-teller), then Noah would be telling the truth when he claims that Daniel is a knave. Conversely, if Noah were a liar (truth-teller), he would be lying about Daniel being a knave, so he would actually be stating that Daniel is a knight. This means Daniel must either be a knight or a knave, but since both scenarios lead to conflicting truths, we cannot conclusively identify Daniel as either type without more information.\n\n**Noah:** The statement \"Daniel is a knight if and only if Daniel is a knave\" presents an inherent contradiction.

Therefore:\n- \"Elizabeth is a knight if and only if Grace is a knave.\" implies that if Elizabeth is a knave, then Grace must not be a knave (i.e., Grace must be a knight).\n\nSo, we have established:\n- Elizabeth is a knave,\n- Grace is a knight,\n\nand now we need to check Daniel's statement:\n- \"Daniel is a knave or Grace is a knight.\" Since Daniel and Grace are known to be different individuals (one being a knight and the other a knave), it follows logically that:\n  - Daniel is definitely a knave.\n\nNow, we have:\n- Aurora, Elizabeth, Grace, and Daniel all classified as either knights or knaves.\n\nSince we know:\n- Elizabeth is a knave,\n- Grace is a knight,\n- Daniel is a knave,\n\nwe conclude that there are two knights (Grace) and two knaves (Elizabeth, Aurora, and Daniel).\n\n### Conclusion\n```plaintext\nSOLUTION: NO\nRESULT: Grace,Aurora,Daniel\n```",

Hence, William can't be a knave.\n\nTherefore, William must be a knight (T).\n\n### Step 2: Determine Mason's Status\n\nSince we know William is a knight (T), let's check his statement again:\n- \"Mason is a knight or Liam is a knight.\"  \n  - If William is T, he told the truth, so at least one of these conditions must hold true. But since William himself is a knight, Mason being a knight is implied directly from William's statement if Mason were a knight.\n\nThus, Mason must also be a knight (T) for William\u2019s statement to be consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Emma's Statement\n\nNow, let's use Emma's statement which says:\n- \"If Liam is a knave then William is a knight.\"\n  - Since William is a knight (T), his statement would have been true regardless of Liam's status because it doesn\u2019t depend on whether Liam is a knight or a knave but rather on William telling the truth.\n\nHence, Emma's statement holds true under any condition involving William and Liam.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- William is a knight (T)\n- Emma is a knight (T)\n- Mason is a knight (T)\n- Liam is a knight (T)\n\nSo the final result is:\n```\nYES\\ \nRESULT: William, Emma, Mason, Liam\n```",

But this leads to a contradiction since Olivia\u2019s statement says Liam is a knight, making Benjamin\u2019s statement false when considering Liam as a knave.\n  \n- Therefore, Benjamin being a knave is consistent with all other statements. If Benjamin is a knave, then his statement \"Benjamin is a knight if and only if Liam is a knave\" becomes \"Benjamin is a knave if and only if Liam is a knave\", which aligns perfectly with the fact that Benjamin is a knave.\n\nSince Benjamin is a knave, Liam can't be a knight (because if Liam was a knight, Benjamin's statement would be true, but we established that Benjamin is a knave). Thus, Liam must be a knave as well, given his own statement about Joseph being a knave.\n\nFinally, Olivia\u2019s statement (\"Liam is a knight\") and Liam\u2019s statement (\"Joseph is a knave\") do not contradict anything we've deduced so far.

Since he claims both parts, if one part is false, the other part would also have to be false.

For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsubject\nTo solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement step-by-step.\n\n1. **Ethan**: \"If Jack is a knight then Ava is a knave.\"\n   - If Jack is a knight (truth-teller), Ava must be a knave (lie).\n   - If Jack is a knave (liar), Ava must be a knight (lies).\n\n2. **Michael**: \"Ava is a knave or Jack is a knight.\"\n   - This can be broken down into two cases:\n     - Case 1: Ava is a knave, Jack is a knight.\n       - Then Michael would say \"False or True\" which is False, consistent.\n     - Case 2: Ava is a knight, Jack is a knight.\n       - Then Michael would say \"True or True\" which is True, inconsistent.\n\n3. **Ava**: \"Michael is a knight and Michael is a knave.\"\n   - This creates a contradiction because it says both \"Michael is a knight\" and \"Michael is a knave.\"\n\n4. **Jack**: \"Michael is a knave and Jack is a knight.\"\n   - If Jack is a knight, then Michael must be a knave (because Jack lies).\n   - However, if Michael is a knave, Jack cannot be a knight (since he tells the truth).\n\nFrom these contradictions, we conclude:\n\n**Conclusion:** Jack is a knave. \n\nSo, the solution is:\n- Ethan is a knight,\n- Michael is a knave,\n- Ava is a knave,\n- Jack is a knave.\n\nTherefore, the final result is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/\nRESULT: Jack is a knave, Ava is a knave, Michael is a knave, Ethan is a knight.\n```",

However, since Abigail is a knight, Benjamin cannot be a knave.\n\n4. **Benjamin's Statement**: \"If Jack is a knave then Jack is a knight.\"\n   - This implies that if Jack is a knave, then Jack must be a knight, which creates a contradiction because it states both conditions simultaneously.\n\nGiven these contradictions, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- If Abigail is a knight (from her statement), then Benjamin is a knight as well, but this contradicts Luke's statement about Benjamin being a knave.\n  \n- Therefore, Abigail cannot be a knight; she must be a knave.\n\nSince Abigail is a knave, Benjamin\u2019s statement becomes irrelevant because his role as a knave means he will lie about any condition involving him being a knave.\n\nThis leaves us with Jack and Luke to determine whether they are knights or knaves:\n\n- Jack says \"Abigail is a knight or Benjamin is a knave.\" Since Abigail is a knave, this statement simplifies to \"Benjamin is a knave.\"\n\n- Luke says \"If Benjamin is a knave then Abigail is a knight,\" which again simplifies to \"False\" because Benjamin is actually a knight, making the implication false.\n\nThus, Jack is a knight because he tells the truth when he claims Benjamin is a knave.\n\n**Final Result:** Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knave, and Ethan is a knave.",

His statement \"If Michael is a knight then Joseph is a knight\" implies that if Michael is telling the truth, then Joseph must be a knight.\n\n### Step 3: Considering Chloe's Statement\n- If Chloe's statement is true, then Michael must be a knave.

So who is a knight and who is a knave?.\nConclude with the final result in EXACTLY this format:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\\ \nRESULT: final_value\n```\nThe final_value should be statements separated by commas. For example, 'Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knight, and Ethan is a knight.'\n\nsystem\nTo solve this problem, let's analyze each statement one by one:\n\n1. **Alexander**: \"If Aria is a knave then Samuel is a knight.\"\n   - This means if Aria is a knave (which she must be because we need to find her), then Samuel is a knight.\n\n2. **Aria**: \"Alexander is a knave and Aria is a knight.\"\n   - If Aria is a knight, then Alexander cannot be a knave (since knights always tell the truth).\n\n3. **Samuel**: \"Aria is a knight and Logan is a knight.\"\n   - Since Aria is a knight, this part of Samuel's statement is true. We don't know yet about Logan but will check later.\n\n4. **Logan**: \"Samuel is not a knight.\"\n   - If Logan says Samuel is not a knight, then Samuel could either be a knight or a knave. However, since we already deduced from Aria that Alexander is a knave, Samuel must be a knight.\n\nNow, let's determine the roles based on these deductions:\n\n- Since Samuel is a knight, his statement \"Aria is a knight\" is true, so Aria is indeed a knight.\n- Alexander's statement is false because Aria is a knave, which contradicts his claim. Therefore, Alexander is a knave.\n- Now knowing Aria is a knight, we can confirm Samuel is a knight as he made a true statement about Aria being a knight.\n- Finally, since both Alexander and Samuel are knights, there are no remaining possibilities for Logarithm, who must also be a knight.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: Michael, Zoey, Ethan\n```",

If Logan is a knight, then his statement must be true. Therefore, either Ava is a knight or Amelia is a knight.\n\n- If Ava is a knight, then her statement about Lucas being a knave contradicts herself because she says Lucas is a knave if and only if she is a knight. This means her statement cannot be true under the assumption that Logan is a knight.\n  \nSince Ava cannot both be a knight and claim that Lucas is a knave while also claiming that she is a knight if and only if Lucas is a knight, we need to check other possibilities for Ava\u2019s status.\n\nNow, let's re-evaluate:\n\n- Suppose Amelia is a knight (she claims that if Lucas is a knight then Logan is a knight).\n- If Amelia is a knight, her statement holds true.

Ava says, \"Grace is not a knight.\"\n3. Grace mentions, \"Ava is a knave if and only if Lucas is a knave.\"\n4. Liam says, \"Grace is a knave if and only if Grace is a knight.\"\n\nTo solve this problem, let's analyze each statement step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Lucas' Statement\n- If Grace is a knight (K), then Ava must also be a knight (K) because it is stated that \"If Grace is a knight, then Ava is a knight.\" This means Grace cannot be a knight; otherwise, it would contradict her own statement that \"Grace is not a knight.\"\n\nSince Grace cannot be a knight, she must be a knave (N).\n\nNow, substitute N for G in Lucas' original statement:\n- Grace is a knave (N). Therefore, \"If Grace is a knight, then Ava is a knight\" becomes \"If N is a knight, then A is a knight,\" which simplifies to \"A is a knight\" since N is false (a knave lies).\n\nSo, Ava is indeed a knight (K).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Ava's Statement\n- Ava says, \"Grace is not a knight.\" Since we have already established that Grace is a knave (N), Ava's statement is true, meaning Grace is not a knight. But we already determined Grace is a knave, so this is consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Grace's Statement\n- Grace mentions, \"Ava is a knave if and only if Lucas is a knave.\"\n  \nGiven:\n- Grace is a knave (N).\n- Ava is a knight (K).\n\nFor Grace's statement to be true, Ava must be a knave (N). However, we know Ava is actually a knight (K), leading to a contradiction unless we reassess our previous assumptions about Grace being a knave.\n\nThus, Grace must be a knight (K), making Ava a knave (N).\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Liam's Statement\n- Liam states, \"Grace is a knave if and only if Grace is a knight.\"\n  - Grace is a knight (K), so the statement \"Grace is a knave if and only if Grace is a knight\" holds true as both conditions are met.\n\n",
