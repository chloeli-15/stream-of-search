Therefore, one of them must be true, but the other must be false based on their nature as either all-knights or all-knaves.\n\n5) **Deduction**:\n   - If Chloe were a knight, her first statement would be false (since Benjamin is indeed a knave).\n   - However, if Chloe were a knave, her first statement would be true (because if Benjamin were a knight, he would also be a knave).\n\n6) **Final Analysis**:\n   - Given that Benjamin is a knave, Chloe\u2019s initial statement must be true, making Chloe a knight.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nNo, No\n```",

But we assumed Z is a knave, leading to a contradiction.\n   - Thus, Z must be a knight: Therefore, S\u2019s claim \u201cIf and only if Z is a knave, then Z is a knight\u201d holds true because Z being a knight makes S\u2019s claim false.\n\n6) **Conclusion**:\n   - Since Z is a knight, S\u2019s claim \u201cIf and only if Z is a knave, then Z is a knight\u201d is false, implying Z is not a knave.\n   - Hence, Z must be a knight, and S must be a knave.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nKnight,Knave\n```",

This implies that both conditions must hold true simultaneously, which is impossible for any single individual to satisfy. Thus, this statement is self-contradictory and false.\n\n2. **Jacobs\u2019 Statement**: \u201cEthan is a knave\u201d.\n   \n3. **Analysis of Statements**:\n   - Since Ethan\u2019s initial statement is false, it means at least one of these initial assumptions about Jacob being a knight or knave is incorrect. We need to consider all possible scenarios based on Jacob\u2019s statement:\n\n4. **Case Analysis**:\n   - **Scenario 1**: Assume Jacob is a knight (truth-teller).\n     - According to Jacob\u2019s statement: \u201cEthan is a knave\u201d. This would imply Ethan is a liar, but our previous analysis showed that Ethan\u2019s initial statement was false, making it consistent with his role as a liar.\n     \n   - **Scenario 2**: Assume Jacob is a knave (liar).\n     - According to Jacob\u2019s statement: \u201cEthan is a knave\u201d. This would imply Ethan is a liar, again consistent with our previous findings that Ethan\u2019s initial statement was false, making him a liar.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Both initial scenarios lead to contradictory results unless we re-evaluate under different interpretations. Given that Ethan\u2019s initial statement directly contradicts itself, no consistent pairings between Ethan and Jacob can emerge without revisiting initial premises leading back to same paradoxical situation indicating none of original assumptions held universally valid initially thus invalidating direct logical deduction via initial flawed premise alone implying inconsistency inherently shows impossibility of reaching unique solution through initial data alone forcing us to conclude both are inconsistent mutually exclusive possibilities remaining unsolvable via initial information alone\n\nConcluding No definitive Knight-Knave Pairing Based solely on Initial Information provided ... \n\n```python\n# Final Result\r\nSOLUTION: NO\r\nRESULT: [], \r\n```\nConclude with the final result in EXACTLY this format:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES/NO\\ \nRESULT: final_value\n```",

However, Benjamin\u2019s statement (which is true here, as Noah is indeed a knave) would also be true, leading to a contradiction because Benjamin\u2019s statement must be false for him to be telling the truth.\n\n3. **One individual is a knight** and **two are knaves**: Without loss of generality, let\u2019s assume Noah is the knight.

If Amelia is a knight, then Penelope is not a knave.\n\n3. **Combining Implications**:\n   - Let\u2019s combine these implications using logical reasoning:\n     - Suppose Amelia is a knight (consistent with Statement 1).\n     - According to Statement 2, if Amelia is a knight, then Penelope must be a knave (from implication 1 above).\n\n4. **Final Conclusions**:\n   - We now have both Penelope\u2019s and Amelia\u2019s statements agreeing on the same scenario: \n     - Amelia is a knight, and Penelope is a knave.\n\nTherefore, the final result is:\n```\nNo, No\n```",

Each of them can be either a Knight or a Knave.\n\n2) Elizabeth made an assertion: \u201cJacob is a knave\u201d. \n\n3) Jacob made a statement: \u201cIf Elizabeth is a knight, then I am a knight.\u201d This is logically equivalent to: \u201cIf E is true, then J is true\u201d.\n\n4) We need to determine which of these individuals are Knights (truth-tellers) and which are Knaves (liars).\n\n5) Since Knights always tell the truth, we know that if E is a Knight, then E must be true, making J also true based on Jacob\u2019s statement. If E is a Knave, then E must be false, making J false based on Jacob\u2019s statement.\n\n6) Conversely, since Knaves always lie, if E is a Knight, then J must be false, which contradicts Jacob\u2019s statement that if E is true, then J is true.

However, since she cannot both be a knight and a knave, this scenario leads to a contradiction.\n\n2. Penelope says: \u201cIf Ella is a knight then Ella is a knave\u201d.\n   - This can be interpreted as: \u201cElla is a knave\u201d because if Ella were a knight, her statement would be false, making it impossible for Penelope to say the same thing.\n\nFrom these initial observations, we have reached a contradiction regarding Penelope\u2019s first statement involving Ella\u2019s identity.

In this case, Oliver\u2019s statement \u201cIf he\u2019s a knight, then Ava is a knave\u201d would be true, but Ava\u2019s statement \u201cIf she\u2019s a knave, then Oliver is a knight\u201d would also be true because Ava is lying, making Oliver\u2019s statement false.

Thus, we can derive that if Logans\u2019 initial statement is true, both he and Avery must be Knights; otherwise, they\u2019re both Knaves.\n\n3) **Deriving Conclusions from Initial Statement\u2019s Truth Value**:\n   - Suppose Logans initial statement is True: Allowing us to infer that, for all Knights, Logans claim holds. This implies:\n     1. Logans\u2019 assertion about Avery being a Knave: If he were a Knight, he would say Avery is a Knave, which contradicts his own statement. Hence, Logans must be a Knave.\n     2. Therefore, Avery must also be a Knave based on Logans\u2019 initial statement being true.\n\n4) **Conclusion Based on Initial Statement\u2019s Truth Value**:\n   - Since Logans initial statement was False, both Avery and Logan cannot both be Knights; hence, at least one of them must be a Knave.\n\n5) **Next Step**: We now know that either **Avery** or **Logan** is a Knave, but not both.

If Avery is a Knight, according to Logans\u2019 initial statement, this leads to a contradiction since Logans said initially \u201cif\u201d condition held, implying Logans\u2019 overall truthfulness via initial statement\u2019s falsity necessitates that Avery, as per initial premise\u2019s logic, must indeed be a Knave given our previous analysis showing no mutual consistency unless Avery",

Benjamin said, \u201cIf Benjamin is a knight then Michael is a knight.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s analyze these statements step-by-step:\n\n### Initial State:\n- **Knights** always tell the truth\n- **Knaves** always lie\n\nWe need to determine if Michael and Benjamin are both knights or one is a knight while the other is a knave.\n\n### Analysis of Michael's Statement\nMichael says, \u201c\u2018Benjamin is a knight\u2019 and \u2018Michael is a knight\u2019.\u201d \n\n- If Michael is a knight, his statement must be true, so both parts must be true:\n  - Benjamin is a knight\n  - Michael is a knight\n- If Michael is a knave, his statement must be false, so at least one part must be false:\n  - Either Benjamin is not a knight (false), or Michael is not a knight (false).\n\n### Analysis of Benjamin\u2019s Statement\nBenjamin says, \u201cIf Benjamin is a knight then Michael is a knight.\u201d\n\n- If Benjamin is a knight, his statement must be true, so Michael must also be a knight.\n- If Benjamin is a knave, his statement must be false, so Michael cannot be a knight.\n\n### Combined Analysis\nWe have two possible scenarios based on Michael\u2019s initial analysis:\n1. Both are knights\n2. One is a knight, the other is a knave\n\n#### Scenario 1: Both are knights\n- Michael\u2019s statement: \u201cBenjamin is a knight\u201d & \u201cMichael is a knight\u201d\n  - Both parts are true, consistent with all being knights.\n\n- Benjamin\u2019s statement: \u201cIf Benjamin is a knight then Michael is a knight\u201d\n  - True, since both are knights.\n\nThis scenario fits perfectly with all initial conditions.\n\n#### Scenario 2: One is a knight, the other is a knave\n- Suppose Michael is a knight and Benjamin is a knave\n  - Michael\u2019s statement: \u201cBenjamin is a knight\u201d & \u201cMichael is a knight\u201d\n    - False, since Benjamin is not a knight\n  - Benjamin\u2019s statement: \u201cIf Benjamin is a knight then Michael is a knight\u201d\n    - False, since Benjamin is a knave\n\nThis scenario leads to contradictions.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent outcome is that **both Michael and Benjamin are knights**.\n\nFinal Result: ['Both Michael and Benjamin are knights'].",

This contradicts Jackson\u2019s statement that, if both were knights, they would contradict each other (one stating he is a knave and the other stating he is a knight), so at least one must be a knave. Since Jackson says either both are knaves or both are knights, if Aurora is a knight, then Jackson cannot be a knight, making him a liar. Therefore, Aurora\u2019s initial assumption led us into contradiction, indicating Aurora is not a knight.\n\n- **Case 2:** Assume Aurora is a knave. Then, according to Aurora\u2019s statement, Jackson must be a knight. This aligns with Jackson\u2019s statement that, if Jackson is a knight, then Ethan must be a knave, which matches our current state where Ethan is a knave. Thus, no contradictions arise from assuming Aurora is a knave.\n\nGiven this analysis, we conclude that **Aurora** is a **knave**, **Ethan** is a **knave**, and **Jackson** is a **knight**.

Lucas is a knave (L_kn).\n     2. Lucas is a knight (L_kn).\n\n   - From Lucas\u2019s statement, we know that Penelope must be a knight (P_kn).

If L_kn = True, then Penelope is indeed a knave, making Lucas\u2019 claim false, implying Lucas is a knight. However, this leads to a contradiction since Penelope cannot both be a knight and a knave at the same time. Therefore, L_kn must be False.\n     2.

Expand \\( K + N \\):\n   - Conjunction distributes over disjunction: \\( (K \\land \\neg K) \\lor (N \\land \\neg K)\\)\n   - Since \\( K \\land \\neg K = \\text{False}\\), it reduces to \\( (N \\land \\neg K)\\)\n   - Therefore, \\( K + N \\equiv N \\land \\neg K \\)\n\n2. Expand \\( \\neg(K \\land K) \\):\n   - Complement law states that \\(\\neg(A \\land A) = \\neg A\\) \n   - Hence, \\( \\neg(K \\land K) = \\neg K \\)\n\n3.

This can be broken down into two implications:\n   - If Zoey is a knight, then Ava must be a knave.\n   - If Zoey is a knave, then Ava must be a knight.\n2. **Considering Zoey\u2019s statement**: \u201cAva is a knave or Luke is a knight\u201d.\n   \n    Let\u2019s analyze each possible scenario for Zoey:\n\n**Case 1:** Assume Zoey is a knight.\n- According to Ava\u2019s statement, if Zoey is a knight, then Ava must be a knave. But Ava\u2019s statement says Ava is a knave, which contradicts our assumption that Zoey is a knight. Hence, Zoey cannot be a knight.\n\n**Case 2:** Assume Zoey is a knave.\n- According to Ava\u2019s statement, if Zoey is a knave, then Ava must be a knight. Now, we know Zoey is a knave, so Ava must indeed be a knight. However, Ava\u2019s statement now tells us that Ava is a knave, which is inconsistent with our previous conclusion that Ava is a knight. Thus, Zoey cannot be a knave.\n\nNone of these initial assumptions lead to consistent results based on all three statements.\n\n**Revising Initial Assumptions**:\nWe need to ensure consistency across all initial statements.

Our goal is to determine their identities based on 3 pieces of information provided:\n\n1. M said: \u201cIf J is a Knight, then V is a Knave.\u201d\n2. J said: \u201cIf J is a Knight, then J is a Knave.\u201d\n3. K said: \u201cIf M is a Knave, then V is a Knight.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s analyze these statements step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing K\u2019s Statement\nK\u2019s statement is: \u201cIf M is a Knave, then V is a Knight.\u201d \n\n- **Case 1**: Assume M is a Knave. According to K\u2019s statement, if M is a Knave, then V would need to be a Knight for the implication to hold true. However, since K also states that J is a Knave, we now have two contradictory scenarios about K\u2019s identity (whether he\u2019s a Knight or a Knave).\n  \n  - If K were a Knight, K\u2019s statement would imply V is a Knight, which contradicts J being a Knave.\n  - If K were a Knave, K\u2019s statement would imply V is a Knight, again contradicting J\u2019s status.\n\nSince both implications lead to contradictions, K cannot be a Knight. Therefore, K must be a Knave.\n\n### Step 2: Exploring K\u2019s Implications\nSince K is a Knave, his last statement implies: \u201cIf M is a Knave, then V is a Knight\u201d is false. This means, in reality, if M is a Knave, V should actually be a Knave. Thus, M\u2019s initial statement \u201cIf J is a Knight, then V is a Knave\u201d can\u2019t be true because it leads to a contradiction when combined with K\u2019s earlier claim that K is a Knave.\n\n### Step 3: Examining M\u2019s Initial Statement\nNow let\u2019s focus on M\u2019s first statement: \u201cIf J is a Knight, then V is a Knave\u201d.\n\n- **Case 1**: Suppose J is a Knave. In this scenario, M\u2019s statement becomes \u201cIf Knave, then Knave\u201d, which is true according to our current assumption that K is a Knave.

Thus, these two cannot hold simultaneously when Grace is a knight.\n\n**Case 2: Grace is a knave**\n- If Grace is a knave, then Ethan must also be a knave according to Ethan\u2019s initial statement. Now, let\u2019s examine Lucas\u2019s statement under this assumption:\n  - If Ethan is a knave, then Lucas\u2019s statement \u201cEthan is a knight\u201d would be false, implying that either Ethan is not a knight or Lucas is not a knight, which aligns with our previous conclusion that Ethan is a knave.\n\nSo, based on all three initial conditions being satisfied only when Grace is a knave, we conclude that:\n\n**Final Result:** Grace is a knave, Ethan is a knave, and Lucas is a knight.",

Let\u2019s assume Liam is a knight (as per his statement).\n   - If Liam is a knight, then according to Liam\u2019s statement, William must also be a knight.\n\n2. Since William is a knight, we know he is telling the truth about Ethan\u2019s status.\n\n3. According to William\u2019s statement, Ethan being a knight implies that Liam is a knight.\n\n4. Combining these two points, we have: \n    * Liam is a knight,\n    * William is a knight,\n    * Thus, according to William's statement, Liam must also be a knight (a contradiction).\n\n5. This shows our initial assumption was incorrect. Therefore, Liam must be a knave.\n\n6. Given Liam is a knave, his claim that William is a knight is false, so William must be a knave as well.\n\n7. Now, consider Emily\u2019s statement: \u201cEmily is a knight or Ethan is a knight.\u201d Since William is a knave, Emily cannot be a knight (because she would contradict her own statement). Hence, Ethan must be a knight.\n\n8. Finally, we check Ethan\u2019s assertion: \u201cWilliam is a knight if and only if Liam is a knight.\u201d Since both William and Liam are knaves, this statement is true.\n\n9. All remaining individuals are now identified: \n    * Liam, Emily, and Ethan are knights, and William is a knave.\n\nBased on these steps, all initial conditions hold true when interpreting them consistently with each individual\u2019s type (Knight = Truth-teller, Knave = Lie-teller).\n\n**Conclusion:** All Initial Conditions Satisfied\n\nThus, no one is a Knave, making everyone a Knight. \n\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nRESULT: ,,,,\n```  \nConcluding with final answer in EXACTLY this format:\n```\nSOLUTION: NO\nRESULT: ,,,,\n```",

But Henry\u2019s second part says he\u2019s a Knight, which is inconsistent with his being a Knave per Lily\u2019s first part.\n  \n   No consistent scenario for Lily leading to all four being Knights.\n\n**Avery:** Says Lily is a KNAVE OR Henry is a KNEE\n- **Analysis**: If Lily is a Knight, then Lily\u2019s first part must be false, meaning Henry must be a Knave. This makes Avery\u2019s statement false because \u201cKnave OR Knave\u201d implies at least one Knave, not both. However, since Lily is indeed a Knight, Avery\u2019s statement must be true, indicating that Henry is also a Knave. This leads to a contradiction with Lily\u2019s initial assertion about her own status as a Knight.\n   \n   No consistent scenario for Avery leading to all four being Knights.\n\n**Henry:** Says Avery is a KNAVE\n- **Analysis**: If Henry is a Knight, his statement must be true, so Avery must be a Knave. This contradicts Lily\u2019s initial assertion that Lily is a Knight.\n  \n   No consistent scenario for Henry leading to all four being Knights.\n\n**Owen:** Says IF Henry is a KNEE THEN Henry is a KNEE\n- **Analysis**: This is logically equivalent to saying \u201cAll Knaves repeat themselves,\u201d implying every Knave confirms the condition for himself.\n- **Verification**: Since Henry is a Knave, he lies about his own identity, confirming the statement\u2019s validity under Knave logic.\n\nBased on logical analysis, none of the initial statements lead to all individuals being Knights simultaneously. Thus, there is no set of identities",

Thus, Lily must be a knight.\n\n2. **Ethan** says, \u201cIf Aiden is a knight, then Sebastian is a knave.\u201d  \n   - We need to check both sub-cases of Aiden\u2019s initial statement to see which one leads to consistent results for Sebastian:\n     - **Sub-case 1**: Aiden is a knight (Lily is a knave). Then, according to Ethan\u2019s statement, if Aiden is a knight, Sebastian must be a knave. This is consistent so far.\n     - **Sub-case 2**: Aiden is a knave (Lily is a knight). Then, according to Ethan\u2019s statement, if Aiden is a knave, Sebastian must be a knight. This contradicts our previous assumption about Aiden being a knave.\n\n3. **Sebastian** claims, \u201cAiden is a knight and Sebastian is a knight.\u201d  \n   - Combining these, we have 2 possible initial states based on Aiden\u2019s initial claim:\n     - **Initial State 1**: Aiden is a knight, Lily is a knave. \n       - Sub-case 1: If Aiden is a knight, Sebastian must be a knave. This is inconsistent with Sebastian claiming Aiden is a knight and Sebastian is a knight.\n     - **Initial State 2**: Aiden is a knave, Lily is a knight. \n       - Sub-case 1: If Aiden is a knave, Sebastian must be a knight. This satisfies Sebastian\u2019s claim as well as Aiden\u2019s initial claim.\n\nBased on these analyses, only **Initial State 2** holds true under consistent logic:\n\n- **Final Result**: Aiden is a knave, Lily is a knight, Sebastian is a knight, and Ethan is a knight. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nSOLUTION: YES\nRESULT: ,,,",

In this case, everyone tells the truth, so we can verify each person\u2019s statement based on this assumption.\n\n1. **All 4 are knights**:\n   - Ella says: \u201cCharlotte is not a knight\u201d. Since all are knights, Charlotte must also be a knight. This makes Ella\u2019s statement false, which contradicts our initial assumption that all are knights.\n   \n2. **3 are knights, 1 is a knave**:\n   - If 3 are knights, then 1 is a knave. The only consistent scenario for this setup is that 1 is a knave (since 3 truths + 1 falsehood = 4).\n   - **Ella**: No evidence supporting her claim, no contradiction yet.\n   - **Charlotte**: David is a knight AND Ella is a knight -> Both true, consistent with 3 knights, 1 knave.\n   - **Aiden**: David is not a knave -> False, since he is a knave.\n   - **David**: Aiden is a knight AND David is a knight -> True, consistent with 3 knights, 1 knave.\n\n3. **2 are knights, 2 are knaves**:\n   - Possible pairings to check consistency: (Ella, Charlotte) & (Aiden, David), (Ella, Aiden) & (Charlotte, David), (Charlotte, Aiden) & (Ella, David)\n   - All three pairs lead to contradictions when assuming 2 knights, 2 knaves\n\n4. **1 is knight, 3 are knaves**:\n   - Only one truthful statement from Ella, Charlotte, or Aiden can hold true without contradicting others\u2019 claims\n\n5. **0 are knights, 4 are knaves**:\n   - All 4 lying simultaneously, no valid consistent scenario\n\nBased on these checks, the only consistent initial state is 3 are knights, 1 is a knave\n\nLowered Initial Consensus #3 : 2 are knights, 2 are knaves\n\nFinal Result #3 : Michael is a knight, Zoey is a knave, and Ethan is a knave.",

Thus, according to Clue 2, Olivia must be a knave.\n\n### Step 2: Consider Case 1: Aiden is a Knight\n- According to Clue 1, Amelia is a knight.\n- Therefore, according to Clue 2, Olivia is a knight.\n  \nIn this scenario, all three individuals (Aiden, Amelia, Olivia) are knights.\n\n### Step 3: Consider Case 2: Aiden is a Knave\n- According to Clue 1, Amelia would need to be a knight for her to be true, but since we\u2019re assuming Aiden is a knave, this leads to a contradiction because Amelia cannot be a knight while being false about herself.\n- Thus, no consistent outcome here.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on our analysis, **only one case** holds logically consistent with all initial statements, making **all four",
